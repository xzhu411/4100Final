Hold My Hand,Michael Jackson Duet With Akon,39,2010,"3 ContributorsChicago Police Torture Summary of Evidence LyricsSUMMARY OF EVIDENCE OF MONELL POLICY AND PRACTICE OF TORTURE AND COVER-UP, AND OF DEFENDANTS MARTIN’S, SHINES’, NEEDHAM’S AND HILLARD’S INVOLVEMENT [REDACTED]  1. Mayor Richard M. Daley was the States’ Attorney of Cook County from 1981 through 1988, and he has served as Mayor of the City of Chicago from 1989 to the present.  2. On or about February 25, 1982, Police Superintendent Richard Brzeczek informed States Attorney Richard M. Daley by letter of the allegations made by Dr. John Raba, that Andrew Wilson had been beaten and electric shocked by Chicago Police detectives at Area 2 on February 14, 1982. 2/25/82 Brzeczek Letter to Daley; Brzeczek Affidavit.  3. Brzeczek further informed Daley that he would not initiate a criminal investigation into the allegations that Wilson was tortured unless Daley authorized such an investigation. Id.  4. Daley never authorized a criminal investigation, and the Chicago Police Department therefore did not initiate a criminal investigation into Wilson’s allegations, and on May 19, 1983, Daley honored Burge and four other Area 2 detectives for their work in the Wilson case” Brzeczek Dep., Wilson v. City of Chicago, pp 123-24; Brzeczek Affidavit; Chicago Tribune, 5/20/83, “Daley Hails 11 in Crime War.”  5. The Chicago Police Department never investigated numerous allegations of police torture and abuse which arose from the manhunt to find and arrest Andrew Wilson and which were lodged with its IAD and OPS in February of 1982. Wilson v. City of Chicago, 6 F3d 1230 (7th Cir. 1993).  6. On November 12, 1982, Andrew Wilson testified at his motion to suppress hearing that he was tortured by Jon Burge, John Yucaitis, and other Area 2 detectives by electric shock, bagging, beating and burning on a radiator. People v. Wilson. 2  7. In their Memorandum In Opposition To Motion To Bar Testimony Concerning Other Alleged Victims of Police Misconduct, filed on January 22, 1992 before the Chicago Police Board in the Matter of Charges Filed against Respondents Jon Burge, John Yucaitis and Patrick O’Hara, Cases # 1856-58, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers, on behalf of the City of Chicago and Chicago Police Superintendent Leroy Martin, judicially admitted that: At the hearing, Andrew Wilson will testify that on February 14, 1982, he was arrested at an apartment by several officers, including respondents Burge and Yucaitis. As Wilson was being taken to the car to be transported to Area II, he heard Burge telling the transporting officers not to “mess with” Wilson and that they would deal with him when they arrived at the station. Wilson was then taken to Area II by Yucaitis and three other officers. Transcript of Testimony of Andrew Wilson, July 7, 10, 11, 1989, at 2914-31 When they arrived at Area II, Wilson was taken to a room where the four transporting officers, including Yucaitis, and other officers started beating him. They hit him, kicked him, knocked him down and slammed him into a window so hard that it broke. In addition, one of the officers grabbed a plastic garbage bag and put it over Wilson’s head, holding it around his neck so that he could not breathe. The officers took the bag off when Wilson bit a hole in it. The officers stopped beating Wilson when Burge entered the room and stated that if it had been him, he would not have left any marks on Wilson. Tr. at 2932-36 Wilson was taken to a second room and handcuffed to the wall. Yucaitis then took Wilson to a telephone and told him to call his brother. When Wilson replied that he did not want to talk but wanted a lawyer, he was taken back to the second room again handcuffed to the wall. Tr. At 2937-44. Burge entered the room and told Wilson he was going to make a statement because Burge’s reputation was at stake. Burge left the room and Yucaitis came in with a brown paper bag. Yucaitis opened the bag and took out a black box about 12-14 inches long, 8-9 inches wide and 6 ½-7 inches high. The box had a crank and two wires with clamps. Yucaitis squatted down in front of Wilson with the box between his own legs, and put one clamp in Wilson’s nose and one on Wilson’s ears, and cranked the box. The shock caused Wilson’s teeth to grind and was so painful that he kicked Yucaitis. Yucaitis punched him in the mouth and cranked the box again. Yucaitis left the room and then returned, put the black box in the bag, and left again. Tr. at 2947-55. Respondent O’Hara then came in and took Wilson to see the Assistant State’s Attorney, Lawrence Hyman. According to Wilson’s testimony, with O’Hara present, Wilson asked Hyman, “You want me to make a statement after they’ve been torturing me?” O’Hara took Wilson back to the second room. Tr. at 2956-59. Burge later returned to the second room with the brown paper bag and said, “Fun time.” Burge put a pair of handcuffs on Wilson’s other arm and another pair on Wilson’s 3 ankles. He then placed the bag in the garbage can and left. He returned, took out the black box, put the clamps on Wilson’s ears and cranked the box. The shock caused Wilson’s to grind his teeth and knocked Wilson out of his chair. Wilson kept rubbing the clips from the electrical device off his ears. Tr at 2961-63. Wilson was then handcuffed across the radiator, kneeling with his arms outstretched. Burge and another officer put the clamps on Wilson’s little fingers and cranked the box repeatedly this time for longer periods. As he was being shocked, Wilson’s chest, leg and face were forced against the radiator and he was burned. Tr. at 2963-66 When Burge stopped cranking and took the clamps off Wilson’s little fingers, he took another shocking device out of the bag. It plugged into an electrical outlet and had a cord sticking out of it. Burge placed the device very near Wilson’s skin so that he could feel it tingling. Burge then jabbed the second device into Wilson’s back and Wilson got a full jolt, slamming Wilson into the grill on the window. Wilson began spitting out blood. Burge and the other officer put the devices back in the bag and left. Tr. at 296-68. A while later, Wilson was taken to Area I headquarters for a lineup. At Area I, Burge stuck his gun in Wilson’s mouth and cocked it back and forth. When Wilson arrived back at Area II after the lineup, Burge told him that if he did not make a statement, he would shock him again. Later, Burge told Wilson he was going to “fry his black ass.” Tr. at 2969-75. Memorandum In Opposition, pp.4-6.  8. In February of 1992, Andrew Wilson testified before the Police Board on behalf of the City in the Matter of Charges Filed against Respondents Jon Burge, John Yucaitis and Patrick O’Hara, Cases # 1856-58, and described his torture in a manner consistent with how the City described it in its January 22, 1992 Memorandum In Opposition To Motion To Bar Testimony Concerning Other Alleged Victims of Police Misconduct, at pp. 4-6; Police Board Testimony of Andrew Wilson.  9. In Wilson v. City of Chicago, 86-C-2360, the City of Chicago, who was a Defendant in that case, admitted in its Amended Answer, dated July 13, 1995, that Andrew Wilson was tortured by Jon Burge on February 14, 1982.  10. Melvin Jones testified on August 5, 1982 at his motion to suppress hearing that he was arrested and transported to Area 2 at 92nd and Cottage Grove on February 5, 1982, and 4 placed in an interview room. People v. Melvin Jones, 8/5/82, pp. 61-62.  11. Melvin Jones testified that while being held in an interview room and interrogated, Lieutenant Jon Burge pulled up a chair and sat in front of Jones who was cuffed to the wall, that Burge had a little wooden box with a long cord, that Burge pulled down Jones’ pants to his ankles and electrically shocked Jones on his foot, then on his thigh and then on his penis. Jones testified that he kept hollering and telling Burge that he wasn’t supposed to do this to him, that Burge said to him that he had no proof, that Burge asked detective Flood, who was present for the shocking, if he saw anything and Flood looked at the ceiling and said no. Jones further stated that Burge said, “[n]o court and no State are going to take your word against a Lieutenant’s word,” and Burge later hit him in the head with a stapler. People v. Jones, 8/5/82, pp. 65-71, 74.  12. Melvin Jones further testified that on February 6, 1982, while he was still being detained in an Area 2 interview room, Defendant McWeeny entered the room with another detective and questioned Jones, after which Lieutenant Burge entered the room and asked McWeeny if Jones had started talking yet. Jones further stated that when McWeeny said Jones hadn’t said anything yet, Burge pulled out a gun and cocked it, put it up to Jones’ head and said he was going to “blow Jones’ black head off.” Id. pp. 76-79. 13. Melvin Jones testified on February 19, 1992 on behalf of the City at the Chicago Police Board Hearing, that McWeeny told Burge to get out of the room and McWeeny stated to him later that evening that he [McWeeny] “had got the Lieutenant off me for right now. He said, if you are going to talk, you know, it would be easier for me.” Id. at 79; Chicago Police Board, 2/19/92, p. 856.  14. Cassandra Watson, Melvin Jones’ attorney in 1982, testified at the Chicago Police 5 Board Hearings on 2/19/92 that Jones told her within the first 10 days of February, 1982 that he had been beaten and threatened at Area 2, that while he was in an interview room at Area 2 a gun had been placed to his head, and that Lieutenant Burge had electrically shocked him with an electrical shock box. Chicago Police Board Proceedings, 2/19/92, pp. 960-62.  15. Jones testified on behalf of the City in the Police Board proceedings against Burge, and again identified Burge as the person who tortured him. Id., p. 826).  16. In their Memorandum In Opposition, filed on January 22, 1992 before the Chicago Police Board, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers, on behalf of Chicago Police Superintendent Leroy Martin and the City of Chicago, judicially admitted that: Melvin Jones will testify that on February 5, 1982, just nine days prior to Andrew Wilson’s arrest, he was taken to an Area II interrogation room where he was handcuffed and questioned by Area II detectives concerning his knowledge and participation in a murder. When he failed to give information implicating himself in the murder, respondent Burge entered the room and told Jones that he was going to talk. Burge then asked Jones if he had ever heard of him, and when Jones replied that he had not, Burge told him that before he left the station Jones would “wish he had never set eyes on him.” Burge left the interrogation room but returned after Jones persisted in his refusal to talk to the interrogating detectives. Burge had Jones cuffed to a second ring and then produced and plugged into the wall socket a wooden box measuring approximately 10"" x 6"" x 6"", with tweezers and a long nail type device. He again asked Jones if he was going to talk. When Jones again refused, Burge pulled down Jones’ pants and shorts and, using the electrical device, shocked Jones three times, on the foot, thigh, and penis. While he was shocking Jones, Burge demanded that Jones talk. He told Jones that he had also shocked “Satan” (Anthony Holmes) and “Cochise,” forcing them to crawl all over the floor. He also told Jones that nobody would believe his word against a lieutenant’s. Burge asked another Area II detective present in the room if he had seen anything, and the detective looked at the ceiling and said no. Burge also tied a sock in Jones’ mouth. Burge was interrupted in his interrogation of Jones, apparently by the news that a policeman had been shot and killed on a bus in his area. Later, Burge also struck Jones with a stapler. When Jones continued to deny knowing anything about the murder, Burge again entered the interrogation room. He pointed a gun at Jones’ head, cocked it and told Jones he was going to “blow his black head off.” 6 City and Martin’s Memorandum In Opposition, pp. 7-8.  17. On May 15, 1995, the City of Chicago admitted that Melvin Jones had been electrically shocked by Jon Burge on his genitals and thigh with a device in a wooden box and threatened with a gun, while he was handcuffed to a ring in the wall in an Area 2 interview room in an attempt to coerce a confession from him. Local Rule 12 N Statement of the City, ¶ 26.  18. In Wilson v. City of Chicago, 86-C-2360, the City of Chicago, who was a Defendant in that case, admitted in its Amended Answer, dated July 13, 1995, that Melvin Jones was tortured by Jon Burge in February of 1982.  18.

During Fogel’s July 26, 1989 deposition, a lawyer for Andrew Wilson, who was conducting the deposition, requested production of Fogel’s file.  55. Lawyers for the City of Chicago refused to produce this file. 13  56. At the Chicago City Council Police Torture Hearings, held on December 24, 1990, counsel for Andrew Wilson publicly informed the members of the committee conducting the Hearings about Mr. Fogel’s electric shock file, and requested that the Committee conducting the Hearings obtain these documents. City Council Hearing, 12/24/90, p. 36.  57. Neither this file nor the documents contained therein were produced by the City, the Police Department, or the OPS to the City Council or the Committee hearing the torture allegations, nor did the City Council nor the Committee obtained the file or the documents contained therein.  58.

Burge, Byrne, City of Chicago, et. al., 91-C-6470, Plaintiff Gregory Banks served upon the City of Chicago Plaintiff’s First Request to Produce which requested in paragraph 11 production of “the CR files, summaries, and any other information concerning of (sic) all other torture and electric shock victims known to the defendant, including, but not limited to, those which former OPS director David Fogel collected and monitored while he was head of OPS.”  59. On or about September 11, 1992, the City, through Assistant Corporation Counsel Margaret Carey, formally responded to this request as follows: “the City has not located any documents pertaining to “known” victims of torture as described in Request # 11.  60. Neither the Fogel electric shock file, nor any documents contained therein, were produced by the City, the Police Department, the OPS, or Ms. Carey at any time during the pendency of his case to Plaintiff Banks or his lawyers.  61. On or about March 15, 1993, in the case entitled Marcus Wiggins v. Burge, Byrne, City of Chicago, et. al., 93 C- 199, Plaintiff Wiggins served upon the City of Chicago Plaintiff’s 14 First Request to Produce to All Defendants which requested in paragraph 11 production of “the CR files, summaries, and any other information concerning all other torture and electric shock victims known to the defendant, including, but not limited to, those which former OPS director David Fogel collected and monitored while he was head of OPS.”  62. On or about April 15, 1996, in a letter to the City seeking compliance with Request #11, Plaintiff Wiggins, through counsel, stated “as to the materials identified by former OPS Director Fogel in his deposition, he left these materials in his official OPS files when he left employment in 1990; hence those materials are clearly defined, not accessible to Plaintiff, but rather remain in your files.”  63. On or about May 16, 1996, the City, through Assistant Corporation Counsel Carey, formally responded by letter to the request for compliance concerning the Fogel File as follows: “I am attempting to see if, in fact, your assertions are correct as to whether David Fogel left these materials at OPS. If you have any information concerning how you know he left the records at OPS, it might assist the City in locating any such files. Once I have received this information, I will let you know what the City can or cannot produce.”  64. On or about May 23, 1996, in another letter to the City seeking compliance with Request # 11, Plaintiff Wiggins, through counsel, stated: “Former OPS Director Fogel testified that he left these documents in his file at OPS when he left at a deposition taken in Fallon and incorporated in this and other Monell cases on September 24, 1992, at pages 637-8. (See Attachment).”  65. In May, 1996, Ms. Carey, by letter, requested that the Police Department search for the Fogel electric shock file. 15  66. On or about July 9, 1996, the City, through Assistant Corporation Counsel Carey, formally again responded by letter to the request for compliance concerning the Fogel electric shock file as follows:”The City has been unable to locate the files plaintiff claims were maintained by Fogel, however we are continuing to look. Consequently, to date and to the extent possible, the City has complied with this request.  67. Neither the Fogel electric shock file, nor any documents contained therein, were produced by the City, the Police Department, the OPS, or Ms. Carey at any time during the pendency of his case to Plaintiff Wiggins or his lawyers.  68. On or about August 11, 2004, the Fogel file and some or all of the documents contained therein was produced by the City to the lawyers for Plaintiffs Patterson, Orange, Hobley and Howard in a Box labeled Box 2.  69.

In 1988, shortly after shortly after Leroy Martin became Superintendent, he transferred Burge from his post as Commander of the Bomb and Arson Unit back to the Detective Division as Commander of Area 3.  71. Also in 1988, Burge requested that Martin intervene with the City Council Finance Committee to obtain private council at the City’s expense to represent him in the Wilson civil trial, and Martin conveyed his request. Letters of 8/23/88 and 10/25/88. 16  72. The City Council approved Burge’s request, William Kunkle, Richard Devine, and their law firm was selected by Burge, and the City paid them approximately $1 million dollars to represent Burge for the next eight years. Letters of 8/23/88 and 10/25/88, Payment Records, Phelan, Pope and John.  73. After Martin transferred Burge to Area 3, key members of Burge’s torture squad - - -including Sergeant Byrne, and Detectives Paladino, Maslanka and Mc Weeny - - - also transferred to Area 3 and allegations of torture began to proliferate there. Plaintiff’s Listing of Known Burge, Area 2 and 3 Torture Victims, 1972-1991.  74. From 1981, when State’s Attorney Daley assumed office, until the end of 1988, when he left office to run for Mayor, approximately 55 victims had alleged torture at Area 2, many allegedly tortured statements had been taken by his assistants, and many motions to suppress where Area 2 torture was alleged had been defended by his office, yet neither Daley nor the SAO initiated any investigations or brought any criminal charges against Burge or any of his men. Id.  75. On July 26, 1989, Mary Powers on behalf of Citizens Alert and several other community groups wrote to OPS Director David Fogel requesting that OPS “reopen an investigation into torture and other abuses by commander Jon Burge,” and that he “support our recommendation that the Chicago Police Board conduct open public hearings into patterns of torture by some members of the Chicago Police Department dating back at least 16 years.” Powers Letter of 7/26/89.  76. In the Powers letter of July 26, 1989, she specifically cited the allegations made by Melvin Jones that he was electric shocked and otherwise abused in February of 1982. Id. 17  77. Neither the OPS nor the CPD opened an investigation into Melvin Jones’ allegations of torture in response to this letter or at any other time.  78. On August 17, 1989, Mary Powers, and other community activists appeared before the Police Board and, in Superintendent Martin”s presence, detailed evidence of a pattern of torture at Area 2 which had come out in the Wilson civil trials, including a description of the torture device, and the finding by the Wilson Jury that there was a pattern and practice of abuse at Area 2, and demanded that a broad investigation be conducted, and that Burge be suspended pending the results of the investigation. Police Board Proceedings, 8/17/89.  79. On September 14, 1989, Mary Powers, and other community activists again appeared before the Police Board and, in Superintendent Martin”s presence, again raised the torture evidence and the demand that Burge be fired. Superintendent Martin responded by stating: “Commander Burge is working, as far as I know, he’ll be working Ms. Powers. I have no reason to suspend Commander Burge. You want him suspended. I have no reason to suspend him at this time.” Police Board Proceedings, 9/14/89, pp. 90-91.  80. In September and October of 1989, the City Council held several days of Hearings into police brutality and torture, at which Mayor Daley gave a statement, and Superintendent Martin and OPS Director Fogel attended and testified. City Council Hearings, September 28-; October 6, 10, 11 1989.  81. Mayor Daley made the following statement to the Committee at the Hearings: “Superintendent Leroy Martin was . . . reappointed by me. He has complete responsibility over the Chicago Police Department. I have full confidence in his administration. He has done an outstanding job.” City Council Hearing, 9/28/89, p. 4.  82. At the hearing, torture at Area 2 was presented through the testimony of Stanley Howard’s mother, OPS Director Fogel was questioned about Burge, electric shock, and 18 baggings at Area 2, Martin was also asked about Howard’s torture, and he promised to look into it. Hearing, 9/29/89, pp 172-215, 10/6/89, pp. 187-96, and 10/10/89, pp. 392-400.  83. On November 30, 1989, Mary Powers, and other community activists again appeared before the Police Board and, in Superintendent Martin’s presence, again raised the torture evidence and the demand that Burge be fired. Superintendent Martin responded by stating: that he wished the activists would follow up on cases where police officers are shot “the way you are following up on the Burge case and see to it that justice is done to the person who took my officer’s life.” Police Board Proceedings, 11/30/89, pp. 19-25.  84. On December 24, 1990, the City Council held Christmas Eve hearings, chaired by Finance Committee Chairman Ed Burke, on the question of police torture at Area 2 during which several witnesses presented numerous allegations of police torture at Area 2. City Council. Hearing, 12/24/90.  85. At the Chicago City Council Hearings held in December 24, 1990, counsel for Andrew Wilson tendered the Committee and its counsel, a 21 page document entitled “Fact Sheet: Evidence of Police Torture By Commander Jon Burge and His Men.”  86. The “Fact Sheet: Evidence of Police Torture By Commander Jon Burge and His Men” which was tendered by counsel for Andrew Wilson to the Committee and its counsel at the Chicago City Council Hearings held on December 24, 1990, listed more than thirty victims of alleged torture at Area 2, including Aaron Patterson, Madison Hobley, Stanley Howard, and Leroy Orange.  87. At the Christmas Eve hearing, evidence that SA Daley refused to investigate when requested to do so by Superintendent Brzeczek. was presented, and Daley responded publicly, with his office stating that “Andrew Wilson refused to testify before the grand jury about the 19 allegations.” Chicago Tribune, 12/25/90, “Hearing Examines Brutality Charges;” Chicago Sun Times, 12/25/90, “Davis Urges New Review of Police Brutality Cases.”  88. The “Fact Sheet: Evidence of Police Torture By Commander Jon Burge and His Men” which listed more than thirty victims of alleged torture at Area 2, including Aaron Patterson, Madison Hobley, Stanley Howard, and Leroy Orange, was tendered by counsel for Andrew Wilson to Superintendent Leroy Martin on or about December 19, 1990.  89. In a letter dated January 9, 1991, OPS Director Gayle Shines wrote to counsel for Andrew Wilson that “Superintendent Martin has referred to me your letter of 19 December and the attached Fact Sheet.”  90. The City Council or its Finance committee never issued a report or took any other action after the December 24th torture hearings.  91. On January 28, 1991, Amnesty International issued a Report calling for “a full inquiry into allegations that Chicago police systematically tortured criminal suspects from 1972 to 1984,” and in response, the spokesman for Mayor Daley said she had “‘no comment whatsoever.’” Chicago Sun Times, 1/28/91, “Police Torture Probe Sought Here.”  92. On or about November 2, 1990 OPS Director Gayle Shines approved as “compelling” and forwarded to Superintendent Martin the 25 page Report and findings made by OPS investigator Michael Goldston concerning allegations of torture and abuse at Area 2. This Report included the following findings: As to the matter of alleged physical abuse, the preponderance of the evidence is that abuse did occur and that it was systematic. The time span involved covers more than ten years. The type of abuse described was not limited to the usual beating, but went into such esoteric areas as psychological techniques and planned torture. The evidence presented by some individuals convinced juries and appellate courts that personnel assigned to Area 2 engaged in methodical abuse. 20 The number of incidents in which an Area 2 command member is identified as an accused can lead to only one conclusion. Particular command members were aware of the systematic abuse and participated in it either by actively participating in same or failing to take any action to bring it to an end. This conclusion is also supported by the number of incidents in which Area 2 offices are named as the location of the abuse. OPS Special Project Conclusion Reports and Findings, and Cover Letter, Shines to Martin, dated November 2, 1990 (Goldston Report).  93. In her forwarding memo of November 2, 1990, OPS Director Shines, while approving the conclusions of Goldston and Sanders, further informed Superintendent Martin that they both did “a masterful job of marshaling the facts in this intensive and extensive project and their conclusions are compelling.” 11/2/90 Cover Memo, Shines to Martin, with OPS Special Project Conclusion Reports and Findings enclosed.  94. On or about November 2, 1990, OPS Director Gayle Shines approved “as compelling” and forwarded to Superintendent Martin the 66 page report and conclusions of OPS investigator Francine Sanders which found that based on “the overwhelming body of evidence which supports the allegations” that administrative charges of excessive force should be sustained against Jon Burge and John Yucaitis including that they “repeatedly administered electrical stimulation to Mr [Andrew] Wilson’s body in order to create pain” and that Burge “held Mr. Wilson, while handcuffed, against a hot radiator causing burns to Mr. Wilson’s face, chest and thigh.” Chicago Police Office of Professional Standards (OPS) Special Investigative Report and Findings, October 26, 1990 (Sanders Report), pp.62-66.  95. Martin acknowledged the “ serious nature” of Goldston’s conclusions Martin memo to Shines, 11/18/90.  96. At no time from receiving the Goldston Report in November of 1990 until he left 21 office in April of 1992, did Martin, OPS Director Shines, or any other City policymaking official take any steps to further investigate the allegations made by the some fifty victims listed in the Goldston report.  97. Instead, Martin, after waiting three months, wrote Shines seeking “further clarification” concerning the Goldston and Sanders Reports. Memo, Martin to Shines, 2/6/91.  98. Despite all of the torture evidence contained in the Goldston and Sanders Reports, in the Fact Sheet, and that was previously presented to Martin and the City Council, the City and Martin did not seek the prosecution of Burge and his confederates in the Wilson case, for a continuing conspiracy on the basis of the numerous other torture cases listed in the Goldston report, or to prosecute Burge for the numerous other cases which were documented in the evidence presented, including the Patterson and Madison Hobley cases.  99. In her April 30, 1991 memorandum to Martin, Shines supplied the “clarifications” sought by Martin, and informed him that the OPS findings “reflect the unprecedented comprehensiveness of this investigation.” Shines memo, 4/30/91.  100. With her April 30, 1991 memorandum to Superintendent Martin, OPS Director Shines included investigator Goldston’s clarification memo, in which Goldston set forth that his investigation established that Area 2 detectives and supervisors Jon Burge, John Byrne, Peter Dignan, Charles Grunhard, John Yucaitis, Thomas McKenna, and Patrick O’Hara were “players” whose names “repeatedly appeared as connected to allegations of abuse.” Goldston Memo of 4/30/91, attached to Shines Memo to Martin of the same date.  101. After waiting an additional seven months, in November of 1991, Superintendent Leroy Martin approved the findings set forth in the Chicago Police Office of Professional 22 Standards (OPS) Special Investigative Report and Findings, dated October 26, 1990 (Sanders Report), Burge and Yucaitis were administratively charged by the CPD for abusing Andrew Wilson in the manner found in the Report, and separation proceedings were initiated before the Chicago Police Board. Cr 123543 (reopened).  102. However, after secret communications with Corporation Counsel Kelly Welch, which the City still refuses to produce, Martin refused to accept or adopt the Goldston findings, open any additional criminal or administrative investigations into the numerous allegations of Area 2 torture, to commission additional investigation into the alleged systemic pattern and practice of torture, or to discipline or seek criminal charges against any of the named officers, but rather contacted the Police Foundation in order to have them evaluate the methodology used by Goldston in arriving at his findings. Martin Letter to Williams, 11/8/91; City Privilege Log.  103. During this time period, community groups, including Citizen’s Alert, by letters and in face to face meetings, were demanding that Martin release the results of the OPS investigation into torture at Area 2. Powers Letter to Martin, 8/14/91.  104. Instead, Martin, through his lawyers at the Corporation Counsel’s Office, fought production and public release of the Goldston Report and its findings. See, generally, proceedings in Fallon v. Dillon, 90 C 6722.  105. In November of 1991, after Defendant Martin and Corporation Counsel Kelly Welsh had initiated proceedings before the Police Board to fire Burge, Yucaitis and O’Hara for torturing Andrew Wilson, Mayor Daley “defended his decision not to take action against the officers when he was state’s attorney in 1982, explaining that . . [Wilson] refused to cooperate with his office at that time.” Chicago Tribune, 11/26/91 “3 Cops Face Hearing in Torture Case.” 23  106. On or about February 7, 1992, the Goldston and Sanders were publicly released, over the City’s strenuous objection, pursuant to the order of Judge Milton Shadur in the case of Fallon v. Dillon, #90-C-6722.  107. In an article which appeared in the February 8, 1992 Chicago Tribune, Superintendent Leroy Martin, whgo was one of the previous Area 2 Commanders, was quoted as saying that it was an “outright lie” that Area 2 commanders knew about or condoned torture. Chicago Tribune, “13 Years of Cop Torture Alleged,” February 8, 1992.  108. In the same article, Mayor Richard M. Daley was quoted as saying of the Report, “these are only allegations . . . not substantiated cases,” as defending Martin’s suppression of the report, stating: “it’s allegations, rumors, stories, things like that” and of denying that the torture at Area 2 was “systematic.” Chicago Tribune, 2/8/92, “13 Years of Cop Torture Alleged;” Los Angeles Times, 2/8/92, “Chicago Police Used Torture Report Says,”  109. In their Memorandum In Opposition To Motion To Bar Testimony Concerning Other Alleged Victims of Police Misconduct, filed on January 22, 1992 before the Police Board in the Matter of Charges Filed against Respondents Jon Burge, John Yucaitis and Patrick O’Hara, Cases # 1856-58, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers, on behalf of Chicago Police Superintendent Leroy Martin and the City of Chicago, made the following judicial admission concerning the testimony of “seven additional victims of torture tactics at Area II headquarters:” The testimony regarding similar acts sets forth detailed accounts of tortuous treatment that are almost identical to the torture suffered by Andrew Wilson. The testimony reveals an astounding pattern or plan on the part of respondents [Burge, Yucaitis and O’Hara] to torture certain suspects, often with substantial criminal records, into confessing to crimes or to condone such activity. 24 Memorandum In Opposition To Motion To Bar Testimony Concerning Other Alleged Victims of Police Misconduct, p. 1.  110. In their Memorandum In Opposition, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers, on behalf of Superintendent Leroy Martin and the City of Chicago, identified the “seven additional victims of torture tactics at Area II headquarters” as Melvin Jones, Anthony Holmes, George Powell, Donald White, Shadeed Mumin, Leroy Orange, and Lawrence Poree. Id., pp. 7- 14. 111. In their Memorandum In Opposition, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers, on behalf of Martin and the City, made the following judicial admission - - - that the similar acts testimony of Melvin Jones, Anthony Holmes, George Powell, Donald White, Shadeed Mumin, Leroy Orange, and Lawrence Poree [I]s highly probative of the modus operandi used or condoned in the torturing of suspects to elicit statements. Respondents [Burge, Yucaitis and O’Hara’s] methods of torture through electric shock, bagging, and holding a gun to a suspect’s head are more that sufficiently unique to establish a modus operandi for 404 b purposes. In addition, the testimony establishes a pattern of and plan to torture these suspects in these similar ways to elicit confessions to violent crimes. Id. p. 17. 112. In their Memorandum In Opposition, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers, on behalf of Martin and the City, judicially admitted that the similar acts testimony of Melvin Jones, Anthony Holmes, George Powell, Donald White, Shadeed Mumin, Leroy Orange, and Lawrence Poree: clearly establishes respondents’ [Burge, Yucaitis and O’Hara’s] motive and intent in torturing or condoning the torture of Wilson. Respondents generally engaged in these similar practices in order to coerce a confession to a serious crime. Id. p. 22. 25 113. In their Memorandum In Opposition, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers, on behalf of Martin and the City, judicially admitted that the similar acts testimony of Melvin Jones, Anthony Holmes, George Powell, Donald White, Shadeed Mumin, Leroy Orange, and Lawrence Poree: shows the physical existence of one or more electric shock devices at Area II, prior to and subsequent to Wilson’s arrest, and Burge’s possession of and familiarity with the use of the devices. It is also admissible to show knowledge of that technique and of the bagging technique, about which respondents deny knowing, and the technique of putting a gun to the head of a victim. Id., p. 24. 114. In their Memorandum In Opposition, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers, on behalf of Martin and the City, made the following judicial admission: There is no question that the similarities between [Andrew] Wilson’s testimony and the similar victims’ testimony is more than sufficient to meet the 404 b standard. Burge was the main perpetrator of the torture in almost all of the cases, and, when he was not the principal, he was still involved. In the case of all but one of the victims, the victim was picked up and taken to Area II where he was then interrogated regarding his knowledge or involvement in a serious offense. Although Donald White was taken instead to Area I, he was taken there and interrogated by Area II detectives. All of the victims were black and generally had significant criminal histories. Also similar was the way in which several victims were threatened with consequences if they refused to make a statement. After an initial refusal, the punishment would begin and then would become stronger and more painful as the refusals to speak persisted. The most striking similarities, however, are found in the methods of torture used on the suspects. Wilson was electro shocked by Yucaitis using the black box and by Burge who used the black box and a curling-iron looking device, was “bagged” and beaten, and was threatened with a gun placed in his mouth. Jones, Holmes, Poree, Powell and Orange were similarly electro shocked by Burge. Holmes, Powell, White and Mumin were all “bagged” and beaten to the point where they lost or almost lost consciousness. Burge pointed a cocked gun at Jones’s head, hit Poree in the head with a pistol, and placed a revolver containing one bullet at Mumin’s head and snapped it three times slowly. White had a gun placed in his mouth. Additionally, each of the victims was slapped around and punched. Burge’s statements to the victims were also very similar. Burge told both Jones and Mumin that nobody would ever believe their word against his. As he did in relation to Wilson, he referred to the absence of marks on Mumin’s body. He said “fun time” as 26 he approached Wilson and Poree with the black box, and laughed when he bagged Mumin. He told Wilson he would “fry his black ass” and Jones he would “blow his black head off.” As the case law cited above aptly demonstrates, these actions or the condoning of these actions are overwhelming in their similarity. Id., pp. 25-26. 115. In their Memorandum In Opposition, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers, on behalf of Chicago Police Superintendent Leroy Martin and the City of Chicago, made the following judicial admission: Given the similarities between the serious offenses charged and the offenses to which the similar victims will testify, there is no question that the offenses are close enough in time to be relevant to this case. Tak[ing] the offenses in sequence, they reveal a pattern of almost identical acts of torture directed towards persons suspected of violent crimes. While the sequence spans twelve years, each offense is close enough to the next to connect it to the relevant pattern of behavior. Moreover, Melvin Jones’ and Donald White’s testimony will demonstrate that they were tortured just days before Andrew Wilson was tortured. Id., p. 28. 116. In their Memorandum In Opposition, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers, on behalf of Leroy Martin and the City of Chicago, judicially admitted: Indeed, as the testimony of the similar victims shows, respondents [Burge, Yucaitis and O’Hara] counted on the fact that their testimony would be believed over that of a convict when they persisted in their pattern of torture. Id., p. 28. 117. In a document filed in the case of Wilson v. City of Chicago, Jon Burge, Patrick O’Hara and John Yucaitis, 86-C-2360, entitled “City of Chicago’s Memorandum in Response To Plaintiff Andrew Wilson’s Motion for Summary Judgment,” the City, through its lawyers, made the following judicial admission: Plaintiff Andrew Wilson has testified that he was beaten, kicked, punched, burned by being harnessed to a radiator, and repeatedly electro shocked on his hands, face, ears, and 27 between his legs by defendant police officers. Plaintiff now seeks summary judgment that this outrageous conduct, unsanctioned and condemned by the City, and for which defendant officers were fired and/or disciplined, was within the defendants’ scope of employment. City Memorandum in Response To Plaintiff Wilson’s Motion for Summary Judgment, p. 1. 118. In a document filed in the case of Wilson v. City of Chicago, 86-C-2360, entitled “City of Chicago’s Memorandum in Response To Plaintiff Andrew Wilson’s Motion for Summary Judgment,” the City, through its lawyers, made the following judicial admission: The instrumentalities by which defendants tortured plaintiff also illustrate that defendant officers were not in the scope of their employment. Plaintiff has failed to furnish any evidence to suggest that the instruments used by the officers to shock him - - -the black box device and the modified curling iron - - were furnished by the City. Id., p. 17. 119. In its Memorandum in Response To Plaintiff Andrew Wilson’s Motion for Summary Judgment,” the City, through its lawyers, made the judicial admission that Burge “cruelly torture[d]” Andrew Wilson and “denie[d] him necessary medical assistance.” Id., p. 19. 120. In this Memorandum, the City, through its lawyers, made the following admission concerning it change of position from defending Burge for his alleged torture of Andrew Wilson to asserting that said torture was so outrageous as to be outside the scope of Burge’s employment: “The change in the City’s position was the result of inquiries undertaken by the City in good faith and in the public interest.” Id. p. 12. 121. On July 30, 1992, almost two years after Superintendent Martin had first received the Goldston findings, the Police Foundation submitted its report to Superintendent of Police Matt Rodriguez. After noting that because “hangings, shockings, ‘baggings’ beatings, chokings, and beatings were alleged to occur, many in the Area 2 Headquarters itself, a thorough and rigorous investigation seemed required,” and that it passed no judgment as to whether the torture alleged had in fact took place, the Report criticized Goldston’s methodology. Police Foundation 28 Report, “An Analysis of the Methods Employed in the Preparation of the Goldston Report,” 7/30/92. 122. The Police Foundation recommended, inter alia, that the Chicago Police Department investigate or re-investigate cases of serious misconduct listed in the Goldston Report, create a database concerning these investigations, rigorously and uniformly investigate them, and create a monitoring system to identify patterns of serious police misconduct. Id. 123. Almost three years after first receiving the Goldston Report, OPS Director Shines reopened the Cannon, Howard, Adkins, Craft, Holmes, White and Michael Johnson cases and assigned OPS investigators to them. Numerous other serious Area 2 torture cases, including those of Plaintiff, Leroy Orange, Melvin Jones, Anthony Homes, George Powell, and Madison Hobley, were not opened or reopened. Shines’ Dep. in Santiago v. Marquez; CRs of named Victims. 124. Leroy Orange testified on May 22,1985, at his trial that on January 12, 1984 he was taken to Area 2 and interrogated. During this interrogation, he was handcuffed behind his back to a circle in the wall, a plastic bag was put over his head, and when the bag was put over his head a second time he was punched in the stomach. People v. Orange, 5/22/85, pp. 1112-14. 125. Leroy Orange further testified that he was shocked on the arm with an electrical device, and that an officer stuck his hands between his legs and squeezed his testicles. Id. at 1114; Affidavits of Leroy Orange. 126. Leroy Orange averred in ¶¶ 11-13 of an affidavit that he was interviewed in the summer of 1990 by a male OPS investigator at Pontiac Correctional Center, and after reviewing a stack of photographs, he identified Jon Burge as one of the detectives involved in his torture. 29 127. OPS Investigator Michael Goldston listed Orange as a victim tortured by Burge in his 1990 OPS report. Goldston Report. 128. Detectives McWeeny and Madigan testified at Orange’s trial that they were partners and they arrested Orange on January 12, 1984, and they transported him to Area 2 Headquarters where they locked him in an interview room, and the next day they conducted lineups with him. People v. Orange, pp. 615-17, 624,1232-34. 129. Leroy Orange stated at his bond hearing on January 14, 1984 that he had pin marks on his butt, that was the only visible bruise he had to show, and that “other things happened.” People v. Orange, Kidd, 1/14/84, p. 3. 130. Orange’s co-defendant, Leonard Kidd, also stated at the January 14th bond hearing that he was hurting between his legs where the police jumped on him, and his lawyer also noted on the record that Kidd was limping and that he came in injured. Id. 131. On February 9, 1984, Orange’s attorney told a reporter for the Chicago Sun Times that officers administered electrical shocks to Orange’s buttocks and anus with a “black box.” “Cop ‘black box’ torture charged,” Chicago Sun Times, 2/9/84. 132. In their Memorandum In Opposition, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers, on behalf of Chicago Superintendent Martin and the City of Chicago, judicially admitted that: In January of 1984, Leroy Orange was taken to Area II where he was interrogated and tortured while Burge was in the room. Orange was shocked and jolted repeatedly with a black box plugged into the wall. Orange’s pants were pulled down while electroshock was applied to his body, including his buttocks. He was then asked if he was ready to make a statement, and he replied that he was. Orange reported this torture to his attorney, Earl Washington, who reported it to the media.. Memorandum In Opposition, January 22, 1992, p. 13. 133. In February of 1984, the OPS registered a complaint, number 136454, alleging that 30 Jon Burge and others who allegedly tortured Leroy Orange on January 12 and 13, 1984. 134. The OPS entered a not sustained finding on these allegations without ever taking a statement from Orange, Burge or any other Area 2 detective or supervisor. 135. The Chicago Police Department has since destroyed the OPS file in complaint number 136454. 136. On or about September 24, 1979, the OPS registered complaint number 108817 alleging that George Powell was beaten and suffocated with a bag while being questioned at Area 2, the OPS entered a not sustained finding on these allegations without ever taking a statement from Powell, Burge, or any other Area 2 detective or supervisor, and the Chicago Police Department has since destroyed the OPS file in complaint number 108817. 137. In their Memorandum In Opposition, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers, on behalf of Superintendent Leroy Martin and the City of Chicago, judicially admitted that: On September 20, 1979, George Powell was arrested at his girlfriend’s house and taken to Area II where he was handcuffed to a wall. Burge brought in a long object with a cord, similar to a cattle prod, and said he was go to do to Powell what he had done to “Satan.” Burge shocked Powell on his stomach and chest, such that Powell almost passed out. Also, while slapping ans questioning Powell, Burge put a bag over Powell’s head and Powell had to bite a hole in it in order to breathe. Powell’s mother filed a complaint with the office of Professional standards, who ultimately made a finding of not sustained. Memorandum In Opposition, filed on January 22, 1992 in the Matter of Charges Filed against Respondents Jon Burge, John Yucaitis and Patrick o’Hara, Cases # 1856-58, p. 9. 138. In a statement taken on June 14, 2004, George Powell stated that he was electric shocked, suffocated with a plastic bag, and beaten by Jon Burge and other Area 2 detectives during his interrogation in September of 1999. 31 139. On May 11, 1989, Andrew Wilson's lawyers in Wilson’s civil rights trial filed ""Plaintiff's Proffer of Other Acts of Beating, Torture and Electroshock By Defendant Burge and Other Detectives."" and served it on the City through counsel. 140. “Plaintiff’s Proffer “listed 19 alleged victims of Burge, Sergeant Byrne, and their fellow Area 2 detectives. 141. “Plaintiff’s Proffer” listed Anthony “Satan” Holmes, stating: Anthony Holmes, nicknamed “Satan, ” was taken to Area II headquarters at approximately 4:00 a.m. Jon Burge presided over his interrogation, during which, in an effort to obtain a confession, plastic bags were put over his head, causing him to pass out three separate times. Burge also applied the end of an electric shock device, housed in a black box, to Holmes’ handcuffs, giving Holmes an intense shock, and causing him to fall out of his chair and roll on the floor. 142. In their Memorandum In Opposition, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers, on behalf of Leroy Martin and the City of Chicago, judicially admitted: On May 30, 1973, at approximately 4:00 a.m., Anthony Holmes, whose street name is “Satan,” was taken to Area II headquarters where he was held, interrogated and tortured for approximately six hours. Respondent Burge presided over his interrogation, during which, in an effort to obtain a confession, plastic bags were placed over Holmes’ head, causing him to pass out three times. Burge also applied the end of an electric shock device, housed in a black box, to Holmes’ handcuffs, giving Holmes an intense shock, which caused him to fall out of his chair and roll on the floor. The shock was extremely painful and caused Holmes to press his jaws together and grit his teeth. Memorandum In Opposition filed on January 22, 1992, p. 9. 143. On April 19, 2004 Anthony Holmes gave a Court reported statement in which he described the allegations made in Plaintiff’s Proffer in even greater detail. 144. Neither the OPS nor the CPD opened an investigation into Anthony Holmes’ allegations in response Plaintiff Wilson’s Proffer, in response to the City’s statements in their January 22, 1992 Memorandum, or at any other time. 32 145. Plaintiff’s Proffer also listed Lawrence Poree, stating: Lawrence Poree was interrogated on two occasions in 1973 by Burge and Hoke. The first time they showed him a wooden box, with no top and a generator inside with two wires. Burge said “this is what we got for niggers like you.” Later (that year) Burge and Hoke put Poree, while handcuffed, on a table and hit him. They then pulled his pants down and applied electric shock to his arm, testicles and under his armpits. 146. In their Memorandum In Opposition, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers, on behalf of Leroy Martin and the City of Chicago, judicially admitted that: Lawrence Poree will testify that on two occasions in 1973, he was interrogated by respondent Burge and another detective. The first time they showed him a wooden box with no top, a generator inside, and two wires. Burge then said, “this is what we’ve got for niggers like you.” Later in 1973, Burge and [detective] Hoke put Poree, while handcuffed, on a table and hit him. They then pulled his pants down and applied electroshock to his arm and armpits, and to his testicles. On August 7, 1979, Poree was arrested and brought to Area II where he was interrogated by Burge. Poree was handcuffed in the interrogation room, and the black box was on the table. Burge came in and said, “fun time again.” Poree was handcuffed to the wall and hit in the head with a pistol. Apparently referring to Anthony Holmes, Burge said “You can ask your fat friend about the box.” Burge shocked Poree eight or nine times on the arms, chest, forehead, and back, causing him to clench his teeth and bite his tongue and his mouth to bleed. (Memorandum In Opposition, January 22, 1992, pp. 13-14. 147. On April 19, 2004 Lawrence Poree gave a Court reported statement in which he described the allegations which were made in Plaintiff’s Proffer in more detail. 148. Neither the OPS nor the CPD opened an investigation into Lawrence Poree’s allegations either in response Plaintiff Wilson’s Proffer, in response to the January 22, 1992, City Memorandum, or at any other time. 149. In U.S. ex. rel. Maxwell v. Gilmore, 1999 WL 130331 (N.D.Ill.) at *14; Judge Shadur stated the following in his decision: It is now common knowledge that in the early to mid-1980s Chicago Police Commander Jon Burge and many officers working under him regularly engaged in the physical abuse 33 and torture of prisoners to extract confessions. Both internal police accounts and numerous lawsuits and appeals brought by suspects alleging such abuse substantiate that those beatings and other means of torture occurred as an established practice, not just on an isolated basis. 150. At the May 13, 2003 oral argument in the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in US ex. rel. Leonard Hinton v. McArdory, Seventh Circuit Judge Diane Wood made the following statement from the bench: “terrible things were happening in Area 2, things that should make us ashamed of our police force and justice system.” 151. In Wilson v. City of Chicago, 120 F.3d 681, 683-85 (7th Cir. 1997), the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals held that Defendant Burge acted within the scope of his employment with the City “when he tortured Wilson,” stating: Burge was not pursuing a frolic of his own. He was enforcing the criminal law of Illinois overzealously by extracting confessions from criminal suspects by improper means. He was, as it were, too loyal an employee. He was acting squarely within the scope of his employment. 152. OPS investigator Veronica [Tillman] Messenger was assigned to investigate the reopened Darrel Cannon OPS complaint (CR #134723) in May, 1993. CR # 134723, TillmanMessenger Testimony, People v.

After Darrell Cannon presented evidence that he was tortured to the Illinois Prisoner Review Board on August 27, 2004 and September 3, 2004, Board Chairman Jorge Montes was quoted in the September 10, 2004 Chicago Sun Times as saying “was there credibility to the [torture] testimony? My inclination is to say ‘yes,’ Mr. Cannon may have been tortured. We found it fairly credible.” Chicago Sun Times, September 10, 2004. 160. Philip Adkins testified at his deposition in his civil case that after he was arrested on June 7, 1984, officers Ron Boffo, James Lotito and Peter Dignan transported him from his home on the south side of Chicago to the vicinity of 53rd and Federal Streets, where they struck him repeatedly about the genitals and abdomen with flashlights until he defecated on himself.

Police Board Hearings, 2/92. 189. In its Memorandum In Opposition, the City and Martin, through their specially appointed counsel, judicially admitted that: On October 30, 1985, Shadeed Mumin was pulled over and arrested by two police officers in an unmarked car. He was taken to Area II and placed in a small room upstairs. Burge entered the room and told Mumin to get up and turn around to the wall. Mumin was then handcuffed behind him to a ring or hook on the wall such that he could not sit down. Burge told Mumin that he wanted to know about the robbery, and Mumin replied that he had no knowledge of what burge was talking about. Burge told Mumin he would talk before Mumin left left there and tightened Mumin’s handcuffs. The handcuffs were painful and cut off Mumin’s circulation. Burge then left the room. Burge returned after a half hour and loosened the handcuffs, asking Mumin if he was ready to talk. When Mumin said he didn’t know what Burge was talking about, Burge became angry and pushed him into a wall. He then removed Mumin’s handcuffs, took him to an office down the hall and handcuffed him. Burge said, “You’re not going to talk, huh?” and Mumin replied that he didn’t know what Burge was talking about. Burge said, “do you know that we can bury you in the penitentiary?” Mumin replied that he still didn’t know what Burge was talking about. Burge then told Mumin that they really wanted his son, and Mumin repeated that he didn’t know what Burge was talking about. Burge became angry and pulled out a fully loaded .44 Magnum. He took out all the bullets except for one, spun it, placed it at 42 Mumin’s head and snapped it three times slowly. Burge told Mumin he was “damned lucky” that Burge didn’t kill him and that he wanted to know about the “fucking robbery.” Burge became angry, jumped up from the desk and snatched a brownish plastic typewriter cover. He said, “you’ll fucking talk or I’ll kill you,” and placed the cover over his head. Burge held the cover over his head and pushed it down in his face so he couldn’t breathe. Mumin, who was handcuffed behind his back, passed out. Burge put it on his head three times. The third time, Mumin hollered and Burge took the cover off and laughed.

Donald White testified at his deposition on July 14, 1989, that he was taken into police custody in February of 1982, brought to Police Headquarters at 11th and State by Area 2 detectives, and placed in a room by detectives Hill, McKenna, and O’Hara. White Deposition in Wilson v. City, 86 C 2360, 7/14/89, pp. 8-9, 17. 212. White further testified that the detectives asked him questions about who killed police officers Fahey and O’Brien, then Hill got angry and said “I’m tired of this fucking shit,” placed a black garbage bag over his head, and then beat him in the head and his chest. Id. at 18, 22, 41. 213. White testified that Hill put the bag over his head two additional times, and that while he was bagged, he was beaten over his head, preventing him from breathing. After the bagging, he said he would tell them anything they wanted to know. Id. at 19-20. 214. White testified that every time the bag was placed over his head, he was hit, and O’Hara, McKenna, Hill and two others were in the room and stood in a circle around him. Id. at 22-23. 215. White further testified that every time he got a detail wrong during the questioning, Detective Hill threatened to hit him and Hill then started to play with his gun and said that he should make him run, shoot him and say that he tried to escape. Id. at 19-21. 47 216. White testified that after they took a statement from him and he took a lie detector test, Hill threatened to shoot him or push him out of a window. Id. at 26, 107. 217. After reviewing 39 photographs at his deposition on July 14, 1989, White identified a picture of Jon Burge as one of the officers who was in the room during the bagging and beating. He also identified Detective Hill’s photograph and stated that he was the officer who put the bag over his head. Id. at 32-36, 38-40, 47, 56. 218. White further testified that at one time while he had the bag over his head, one of the officers put a gun to his mouth, and at another point, he was hit with fists and a book, or a stack of something. Id. at 42, 62. 219. In their Memorandum In Opposition, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers, on behalf of Superintendent Martin and the City of Chicago, judicially admitted: On the evening of February 12, 1982, two days before Andrew Wilson’s arrest, Donald White was picked up by police officers and taken to 11th and State. He was taken to a room on the 5th floor by Hill, McKenna, Katalinic and respondent O’Hara, and they began asking him who killed the police officers. They continued to ask him and White repeatedly told them that he did not shoot the officers. Hill got mad and said “I am tired of this fucking shit.” He took a black garbage bag and put it over White’s head and then someone began beating him on his head. Although he could not see them with the bag over his head, there had to have been at least four people hitting him. O’Hara was in the room, as was Burge at various times. When White still stated that he did not shoot the officers and did not know anything, they put the bag back over his head two more times and beat him again. White almost lost consiousness. At one point, someone stuck a gun in his mouth. White then said he would tell them anything they wanted to know. Hill then asked him questions, and, when White didn’t have it right, Hill pretended he was going to hit White. White testified to these facts in a deposition taken in connection with Andrew Wilson’s civil trial. White had not told anyone for five years that he had been abused because he feared for his life at the hands of the police officers. When he finally agreed to testify about the abuse he suffered, he did so only on the condition that Wilson’s lawyers would move him out of Illinois. In addition, because he was afraid and did not know who he could trust, he did not file an OPS complaint. His mother, however, did file an OPS complaint in connection with his torture at the hands of the police officers. OPS reached a finding of “not sustained.” 48 Memorandum In Opposition filed on January 22, 1992 in the Matter of Charges Filed against Respondents Jon Burge, et. al. , Cases # 1856-58, pp. 10-11. 221.

Id., pp. 396-404. 223. Patterson further testified that Pienta threatened to do something worse to him if he did not cooperate, that he repeatedly asked for an attorney and persisted in refusing to cooperate, so the detectives again turned off the lights and put the plastic cover over his head. Patterson further testified that the same seven Detectives who were present for the first round of torture, including Pienta, William Marley, and William Pederson, were present again Id.,, pp. 405-7. 224. Patterson testified that on this second occasion, the ""bagging"" went on for at least two minutes, he was again punched on the body when the bag was over his head, and that suffocation was even more unbearable than the first time, so he stated to the detectives that he would say ""anything you say."" Id, pp. 406-7. 49 225.

Id., pp. 415-16. 228. Patterson testified that the red haired officer returned to the room, said ""you're fucking up,"" took his revolver out, put it on the table top, and said ""we told you if you don't do what we tell you to, you're going to get something worse than before -- it will have been a snap compared to what you will get."" Patterson further testified that the red haired officer then asked Petitioner if he was going to cooperate, said that if Petitioner revealed the torture, ""its your word against ours and who are they going to believe, you or us,"" and stated that they could do anything they wanted to do to him. Id., pp. 417-19. 229. Patterson further testified that a second ASA, Peter Troy, came in sometime the next day with Detective Madigan, he first agreed to make a statement then refused to do so or to sign a written statement which Troy had written out. Id., pp. 422-34. 50 230. Aaron Patterson testified that he continued to refuse to sign the statement, ASA Troy physically attacked him, and then Detective Daniel McWeeney entered the room, professed not to be involved in the prior brutality, and urged him to cooperate because the other detectives ""could do something serious to him if he didn't."" Id., pp. 422-435. 231. In an affidavit, Aaron Patterson averred that the red haired officer was Jon Burge, and that he had so identified him to his criminal defense lawyer in 1989.

On January 10, 2003, Illinois Governor George Ryan granted four Burge death row torture victims, Plaintiffs Aaron Patterson, Madison Hobley, Leroy Orange and Stanley Howard, pardons on the basis of innocence, finding: The category of horrors was hard to believe. If I hadn't reviewed the cases myself, I wouldn't believe it. We have evidence from four men, who did not know each other, all getting beaten and tortured and convicted on the basis of the confessions they allegedly provided. They are perfect examples of what is so terribly broken about our system. Statement of Governor George Ryan, Depaul University School of Law, January 10, 2003. 53 248.

On October 11, 1989, Police Superintendent Leroy Martin testified before the Chicago City Council and gave the following answers to the following question by Alderman Caldwell: Q: One final question, Superintendent, and this was asked of Dr. Fogel on numerous occasions.

On or about October 19, 1987, OPS Director Fogel sent a document entitled “Proposed Revamping of Office of Professional Standards,” to the Mayor of the City of Chicago in which he wrote: By accepting all cases, even erring on the liberal side, to be accommodative to the public, OPS gives the appearance of moving forward on all complaints. The opposite occurs. The appearance of doing a thorough investigation with full due process and endless unnecessary reviews for all, actually operates to immunize police from internal discipline, increases their overtime, leads to an enormous “paper storm” and has institutionalized lying. “Proposed Revamping of Office of Professional Standards,” October 19, 1987, p. 2. 359. [Deleted] 360. In Jones v. City of Chicago, 856 F. 2d 985, (7th Cir. 1987) the Seventh Circuit 76 Court of Appeals affirmed a jury verdict against Area 2 Violent Crimes detectives, supervisors and commanding officers, including detectives James Houtsma, Dennis McGuire, John McCabe, and Raymond McNally, Sgt. Alvin Palmer, Lt. Griffith, and Commander Milton Deas, for conspiracy to “railroad” 18 year old George Jones for a 1981 murder, stating: We cannot say that the jury acted unreasonably in finding that all of the individual defendants were voluntary participants in a common venture to railroad George Jones. Jones v. City of Chicago, 856 F. 2d at 992. 361. In Jones v. City of Chicago, the Seventh Circuit affirmed a jury verdict against the City of Chicago for maintaining a “street files”custom or policy which led to the railroading of 18 year old George Jones for a 1981 murder, stating: The custom in question is the maintenance of the ""street files,"" police files withheld from the state's attorney and therefore unavailable as a source of exculpatory information that might induce him not to prosecute or, failing that, would at least be available to defense counsel under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 10 L. Ed. 2d 215, 83 S. Ct. 1194 (1963). As we noted recently, information undermining the credibility of a government witness is within the scope of Brady's rule. See United States v. Herrera-Medina, 853 F.2d 564, slip op. at 5 (7th Cir. 1988). Although the lawfulness of the street-files practice has never been adjudicated, the City, which has abandoned the practice, does not challenge the jury's implicit finding that it denied criminal defendants due process of law. Brady v. Maryland does not require the police to keep written records of all their investigatory activities; but attempts to circumvent the rule of that case by retaining records in clandestine files deliberately concealed from prosecutors and defense counsel cannot be tolerated. The City sensibly does not attempt to defend such behavior in this court. There is little doubt that the clandestine character of the street files played a role in Jones's misfortunes. Cf. Harris v. City of Pagedale, 821 F.2d 499, 507 (8th Cir. 1987). If the state's attorney had had [*996] access to them, he would have discovered memos by Kelly and especially by Laverty that would have given any prosecutor pause. Alternatively, defense 77 counsel would have obtained them prior to trial and the trial would have ended even sooner than it did. The only question is whether this custom was a custom of the City of Chicago. As the custom was department-wide and of long standing, the jury was entitled to conclude that it had been consciously approved at the highest policy-making level for decisions involving the police department -- the standard suggested by the recent plurality opinion in City of St. Louis v. Praprotnik, 485 U.S. 112, 108 S. Ct. 915, 99 L. Ed. 2d 107 (1988). See also Stokes v. Bullins, 844 F.2d 269, 273 (5th Cir. 1988). Jones, 856 F. 2d at 995. 362.

In a sworn court reported statement dated July 24, 2004, Rodney Mastin averred that on August 4 or 5, 1972 detectives, including Jon Burge came to his house and took him and Philip “Smoky” Moore to Area 2 for questioning about a home invasion which had left a young white boy severely injured. Statement of Rodney Mastin, pp 4-6. 554. In his statement, Mastin averred that on August 4 or 5, 1972, Area 2 detectives, including Jon Burge, took him and Moore up the stairs at Area 2 then past a room where he saw an unrecognizable person handcuffed to the wall in a room he walked by. He further averred that the young black male looked like he had been in a car accident, with his facial features distorted, swollen and bleeding, apparently seriously injured and unconscious. Id., pp 7-9. 555. In his statement, Mastin averred that Burge and the other detectives then took him and Moore into an open room, told them that they knew that he and “Smoky” were involved in a home invasion during which a young boy had been severely beaten, and that before they left the room they were going to tell them everything they knew about the case. Id., pp 8-10. 556. In his statement, Mastin further averred that the detectives then brought the unrecognizable man in from the other room and sat him down across from Mastin and Moore, and he recognized the person as Lindsey Smith, a person he knew very well and saw on a daily 107 basis. Id., pp 10-11. 557. Rodney Mastin further averred that the detective asked Smith, who looked like a mess, who was involved in the beating and home invasion, and Smith said “Rodney and Smoky did it.” Id., pp 11-12. 558. In his statement, Mastin averred that Moore and Smith were taken from the room and he was questioned by Burge. He further averred that Burge was walking around him during the questioning, and when he gave answers that Burge did not like, he was either punched in the head or knocked to the floor, he was kicked once in the groin, slapped, backhanded, punched in the chest and face, snatched from the floor and slammed back into the chair, and hit on the head with an ashtray. Id., pp 13-16. 559. Mastin further averred that Burge was always in the room and was one of the officers who did the beatings. He further averred that there was always at least two officers in the room, with others coming and going. Id., pp 13-14. 560. Mastin averred that he gave a written statement so the beatings would stop. Id., pp 16-18. 561. Mastin further averred that pictures were taken of Smith which showed his distorted face and that Moore later told him that he was punched during his questioning. Id., pp 19-20. 562. In his statement, Mastin averred that there was a motion to suppress hearing at which evidence of the beatings was presented and at which Burge and other detectives testified and denied any abuse. Id., pp 25-26. 563. In a sworn court reported statement taken on August 25, 2004, Ollie Hammonds averred that on or about September 21, 1979, he was arrested by Chicago Police officers, 108 including Jon Burge, and George Basile,, and taken to Area 2 where he was questioned about the same homicide that George Powell was arrested for. 8/25/04 Hammonds Statement, pp. 2-5. 564. Hammonds further averred that when he denied involvement, Burge, Basile, and two other detectives beat him on his chest and legs. These beatings continued for six to eight hours. Id. pp. 6-8. 565. Hammonds further averred that sometime during this six to eight hour period, Basile produced a black box, the size of a car battery, which had prongs sticking up and two wires extending from it. Id., pp. 8-9. 566. Hammonds further averred that Burge asked him did he know what this did to a man’s dick if we put the two wires on it, and Basile demonstrated it by touching the two wires together, and sparks jumped out. Id., p. 9. 567. Hammonds averred that he told them he would tell them what they wanted him to say, but he would tell the judge that they told him to say it. The detectives were not satisfied, and they moved him to a cell where they handcuffed him to the wall, and held him incommunicado for two and one half days, without food, water, or access to the washroom. Id., pp. 9-10, 13 568. Hammonds further averred that during this period of time, he refused to cooperate, and Burge, Basile, and the other detectives punched him on numerous occasions. Id., pp. 10-11. 569. Hammonds averred that he was charged with the same murder as George Powell was charged with, was held inCounty Jail for 33 days, then released when the Judge found no probable cause. Id., pp. 15-16. 570. In an OPS statement, Ty Shaun Ross stated that he was electric shocked and otherwise abused by Area 3 detectives, including Daniel McWeeny, while he was being 109 interrogated on June 5, 1991. CR 185626. 571. [Deleted] while his co-defendant, Travis Richardson, stated that his head was slammed on a table. [Deleted]. 572. All of the 100 alleged victims of police torture and abuse by Area 2 and Area 3 detectives and supervisors whose allegations are known to the Plaintiff are African-American. Plaintiff’s Listing of Known Burge, Area 2 and 3 Torture Victims, 1972-1991. 573. On April 24, 2002, Judge Paul Biebel, Chief Judge of the Cook County Criminal Division, appointed Special Prosecutors Edward Egan and Robert Boyle to investigate allegations of police torture and abuse at Area 2 and Area 3. 574. On June 8, 2004, in open court, Special Prosecutor Robert Boyle stated that the Special Prosecutor’s Office was investigating 108 cases of alleged torture and physical abuse at Area 2 and 3. In Re: The Matters of Leonard Bajenski, et. al., June 8, 2004, p. 27. 575. From 1972 to the present, the only police department discipline which has been imposed against any Area 2 or Area 3 detective, supervisor, or command officer for any allegations of torture or physical abuse made against them has been the firing of Jon Burge and the suspension of John Yucaitis for the torture of Andrew Wilson on February 14, 1982. 576. From 1972 to the present, the City of Chicago and its Police Department has conducted no criminal investigations into any of the allegations of torture or other physical abuse made against Area 2 and Area 3 detectives and supervisors, including, but not limited to, the alleged victims named above. 577. From 1972 to the present, the City of Chicago and its Police Department has not sought criminal charges against any Area 2 and Area 3 detective or supervisor on the basis of 110 allegations of torture or other physical abuse, including, but not limited to, those made by the alleged victims named above. 578. On February 11, 1993., the Chicago Police Board ordered that Jon Burge be separated from the Chicago Police Department and John Yucaitis be suspended for 15 months for torturing and physically abusing Andrew Wilson. In The Matter of the Charges Filed Against Jon Burge, No. 91-1856 (Chicago Police Board, February 11, 1993). 579. On February 10, 1994, Cook County Circuit Court Judge Thomas O’Brien affirmed the Police Board’s order separating Burge and suspending Yucaitis, and on December 15, 1995, the Illinois Appellate Court affirmed Judge O’Brien’s ruling. Burge v. Police Board of the City of Chicago, No. 93 CH 2265, (Circuit Court of Cook County, February 10, 1994); Burge, O’Hara and Yucaitis v.

The following criminal defendants who have alleged torture and abuse by Area 2 or 3 detectives have received new hearings or trial, or had their statement suppressed on the basis of evidence of Area 2 or 3 torture and abuse in the following cases: a. Andrew Wilson : People v. Wilson, 116 Ill.2d 29 (1987); b. Darrell Cannon: People v. Cannon, 293 lll. App. 3d 634 (1997); c. Aaron Patterson: People v. Patterson, 192 Ill. 2d 93, (2000); d.

In a May 21, 2003 Chicago Tribune article, Special Prosecutor Egan was quoted as saying: ""We believe something happened. You'd have to be a chump not to."" “Probers Believe Brutality Claims,” Chicago Tribune, May 21, 2003. 583. On March 3, 1998, upon becoming Police Superintendent, Terry Hillard told the Chicago Sun Times that “barring new evidence, it's time to close the book on the Burge era and move on.” Hillard Dep., Santiago v. Marquez, 5/3/99, pp. 32-33, 35-36, 43-46 584. In an August 31, 1998 memo from the office of the Superintendent , Thomas Needham, General Counsel to the Superintendent, to Leonard Benefico, Office of Professional Standards, Needham listed the following cases: Darrell Cannon CR#134723 Stanley Howard CR# 142017 Gregory Banks CR# 188617 Lee Holmes CR# 126802 Philip Adkins CR# 142201 Donald White CR# 169867 Lavert Jones CR# 200390 Stanley Ware CR# 202019 112 Michael Johnson CR# 125071 and wrote that “you are hereby instructed to classify all of the allegations in the above referenced complaint register files as ‘not sustained.’” August 31, 1998 memo from Thomas Needham, General Counsel to the Superintendent, to Leonard Benefico, Office of Professional Standards. 585. As a basis for this unprecedented order, Needham cited the age of the cases and the purported lack of “new evidence,” when, in fact, a wealth of new evidence had been developed by the OPS investigators in almost all of the cases. Id.; CR files of listed cases; Testimony of OPS investigators at People v. Cannon Hearing. 586. Superintendent Hillard, after talking to Neeedham about his decision, ratified his actions in “not sustaining’” these cases, stating, under oath, that “I support Tom Needham 100 percent when it comes down to representing me in this department in hard cases like that.” Hillard Dep., Santiago v. Marquez, 5/3/99, pp. 32-33, 35-36. 587. In a letter dated August 2, 1999, from Citizens Alert, addressed to Superintendent Terry Hillard, OPS Director Callie Baird and Police Board President Demitrius Carney, the signators wrote: We write as a group of public officials, citizens and organizations concerned with police violence and discipline to urge you to immediately reopen and review several Office of Professional Standards (OPS) investigations into police torture, and to open investigations in numerous other torture cases where no OPS investigations have been conducted. We further urge you to commission an independent investigation into the obvious violations of police regulations and procedure and legal process by certain OPS and police officials during the torture investigations which were conducted by the OPS. August 2, 1999 Letter from Citizens Alert, Mary Powers et. al. to Hillard, Carney, and Baird. 588. In the August 2, 1999 letter, the signators further wrote: 113 Recent news articles and publicly released documents and depositions reveal that the OPS reopened nine torture investigations in 1992 and 1993 as a result of prior OPS findings that physical abuse of African American suspects at Area 2 from 1973 to 1986 included ""psychological techniques and planned torture,"" was ""systematic,"" and ""methodical,"" and that Area 2 command members, particularly Jon Burge, ""were aware of the systematic abuse and perpetuated it either by actively participating in same or failing to take any action to bring it to an end."" Goldston Report, pp 2-3. The now public evidence further reveals that OPS investigators Tillman, Lawrence, and Cosey conducted thorough investigations in each of these cases, discovered new evidence not available during the initial investigations, and sustained findings in six of the cases. The sustained findings included findings that victims were electric shocked, suffocated with a plastic bag, suspended in air by their handcuffs, beaten and stomped, and racially abused. The evidence further shows that these sustained findings were entered against several police officers who were and are still Chicago police officers in good standing, most notably Lieutenant Peter Dignan, who had allegations of torture and abuse sustained against him in five of the six cases. The evidence further reveals that these findings and the investigative files were tendered to OPS Director Gayle Shines in 1994 for her review, and that she overturned the findings in four of the cases in late 1994 and early 1995, at the same time that Peter Dignan was nominated by the Mayor and the Department for merit promotion to Lieutenant. Ms. Shines has admitted that in the approximately 2500 sustained cases which she reviewed during her eight year career as Director, she overturned a total of 10 cases, including these four against Dignan. The evidence further shows that in the other two cases, Darrell Cannon and Stanley Howard, Ms. Shines never completed her review of the sustained findings of torture, but rather kept these files in her office for four years, together with the other seven files. Cannon, who was on trial in a murder case, and Howard, who is on death row, sought these files by subpoena, but Shines and the Department failed to produce these files, which contained highly exculpatory evidence. Furthermore, after Ms. Shines left the OPS in 1998, counsel to the Superintendent, Thomas Needham, obtained the nine torture files from the OPS and, without consultation with the Superintendent, summarily reversed the sustained findings and closed the cases. Needham, who, as a longtime assistant state’s attorney, was closely connected to the prosecution of several torture victims, including Cannon, admitted that his summary reversals of the torture findings were not based on the merits of the cases, but rather on the fact that the files had languished in Shines’ office for so long a period of time. The Superintendent never reviewed these cases on the merits as he is required by police procedure to do, and he only learned of his counsel’s unjustifiable actions by reading about them in a February 1999 Chicago Tribune article. Additionally, the public evidence reveals that the OPS failed to investigate numerous additional documented cases of police torture against African American suspects. In the case of Melvin Jones, Mary Powers of Citizen’s Alert specifically requested by a letter dated July 26, 1989 that the OPS open an investigation into the recently revealed allegations that Jones was electric shocked at by Jon Burge and several other Area 2 detectives who remain on the force to this day. Contrary to police and OPS procedure, no investigation was ever opened, despite the fact that the City has subsequently admitted in 114 official court papers that Jones was in fact tortured. Similarly, in the Shadeed Mumin case, an investigation was opened and OPS investigators developed compelling new evidence that he was tortured by Burge and an unidentified detective. Just as the OPS investigator was about to identify this officer, the OPS discontinued the investigation, supposedly because the investigation had not been assigned a complaint register number. In numerous other cases, including Aaron Patterson and nine other men who are presently on death row as a result of confessions which they allege were tortured from them, the OPS has failed to conduct any investigation whatsoever into these most serious allegations. Id. 589. In the August 2, 1999 letter, the signators made the following demands: 1. Given Ms. Shines’ clear misconduct, lack of objectivity, and failure to complete her review of the Cannon and Howard sustained findings, that new OPS Director, Callie Baird, conduct an independent review on the merits of the six sustained torture cases; 2. If Ms. Baird concurs with one or more of the sustained findings, that the Superintendent fully and fairly review those findings on the merits, as he is required by police procedure to do; 3. That counsel Thomas Needham be disqualified from any role in reviewing or otherwise participating in any torture investigations; 4. That Peter Dignan and any other active officers against whom torture findings were entered by OPS investigators be suspended pending complete review; 5. That the department and its OPS open an investigation into the allegations that Melvin Jones was electric shocked by Jon Burge and other still active detectives and consider in making its findings that the City has admitted that Jones was in fact tortured; 6. That the Department and its OPS reopen and complete the Shadeed Mumin investigation; 7. That the Department and its OPS open investigations into the other numerous documented cases of police torture, as listed in the Appendix attached hereto, including those allegations made by men on death row; 8. That the Department commission an independent investigation into the serious violations of departmental rules and court process by high ranking police and OPS officials, including Thomas Needham and Gayle Shines; 9. That the Department and the OPS Director meet with representatives from the undersigned groups and discuss these proposals and to periodically report on the progress of these investigations; 10.That these investigations and findings be subject to public scrutiny. Id. 115 590. In the August 2, 1999, from Citizens Alert, the signators set forth the following cases for Director Baird’s Review: Darrell Cannon CR#134723 Stanley Howard CR# 142017 Gregory Banks CR# 188617 David Bates CR# 188617 Lee Holmes CR# 126802 Philip Adkins CR# 142201 Thomas Craft CR# 200390 Id. 591. In the August 2, 1999, letter, the signators listed the following cases to be Opened8 by OPS: Melvin Jones TyShaun Ross Shadeed Mumin Derrick King Aaron Patterson Michael Coleman Leonard Hinton Sylvester Green Leroy Orange Paul Mike Alonzo Smith Walter Johnson Leonard Hinton Roy Brown Leroy Orange Eric Smith Jerry Mahaffey Franklin Burchette Reginald Mahaffey Vincent Wade James Cody Willie Porch Lenard Kidd Raymond Golden Lonza Holmes Tony Thompson Michael Tillman Timothy Thompson Stephen Bell Andrew Maxwell Madison Hobley Ronald Kitchen Id. 592. Superintendent Hillard subsequently met with representatives from the signators of the August 2, 1999 Citizens Alert letter. 593. Other than Hillard’s meeting with representatives from the signators of the August 2, 1999 Citizens Alert letter, no action was taken on any of the demands made in the letter. 116 594. In an e mail dated 1/10/02, Corporation Counsel Mara S. Georges wrote to her assistant: “Sheila O’Grady would like us to explore bringing an action against Burge. Will you please think about it and give us your thoughts?” “New documents Report that City Considered Suing Burge, City continues Paying For Fired Commander’s Legal Defense,” NBC 5.com., 4/29/04. 595. On January 1, 2002, Sheila O’Grady was Mayor Daley’s Chief of Staff. Id. 596. In response, Jeffrey Given, Georges’ assistant, wrote that suing Burge “would seem to undercut our ability to defend [against the inmates’] suit by challenging the underlying facts . . .” “City Considered Suing Burge; Officials Weighed Their Options to Fight Growing Uproar over Torture Allegations Against the Fired Police Commander,” Chicago Tribune, 4/29/04. 597. Mindful that the torture allegations were gaining new momentum, Given and Georges also considered mounting a public relations campaign to counter continuing negative publicity about Burge and the City’s role in the torture scandal. Id. 598. Given and Georges recognized that the campaign would not be easy for a wide variety of reasons, including that some of Burge’s men were still on the police force, the department had been embarrassed by Needham’s unilateral shelving of the OPS torture investigations despite the investigators’ sustained findings, and that the Tribune’s then recent series on the continuing CPD practice of obtaining false confessions had again focused attention on the issue, and Given further stated “but query how we’ll do in the court of public opinion after a long, public, expensive and embarrassing discovery process?” NBC5.com; Chicago Tribune. 599. Instead of suing Burge, or otherwise distancing the City from him, the City decided 117 to invest unlimited public funds in representing Burge and at least thirty-five other Area 2 detectives accused of torture and abuse in the four torture cases and to fight production and public disclosure of additional documents that would further expose the City’s central role in the torture scandal in civil and criminal cases and with the Special Prosecutor. Id. 600. On August 27, 2004 in his sworn testimony before the Prisoner Review Board, former Area 2 Commander and Superintendent Leroy Martin falsely denied that he did not have contemporaneous knowledge of the allegations of torture and abuse against Jon Burge and other Area 2 detectives while he was Commander. Tr. of 8/27/04 Parole Revocation Hearing of Darrell Cannon. 601. In her concurring opinion in Hinton v. Uchtman (sub. nom.)___F 3d ___ (7th Cir. 2005), Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Diane Wood found: [T]he claim Hinton has made regarding his confession illustrates dramatically the high price our system of criminal justice pays when police abuse runs rampant: a cloud hangs over everything that the bad actors touched . . . [A] mountain of evidence indicates that torture was an ordinary occurrence at the Area Two station of the Chicago Police Department during the exact time period pertinent to Hinton's case. Eventually, as this sorry tale came to light, the Office of Professional Standards Investigation of the Police Department looked into the allegations, and it issued a report that concluded that police torture under the command of Lt. Jon Burge — the officer in charge of Hinton's case — had been a regular part of the system for more than ten years. And, in language reminiscent of the news reports of 2004 concerning the notorious Abu Ghraib facility in Iraq, the report said that ""[t]he type of abuse described was not limited to the usual beating, but went into such esoteric areas as psychological techniques and planned torture."" The report detailed specific cases, such as the case of Andrew Wilson, who was taken to Area Two on February 14, 1982. There a group led by Burge beat Wilson, stuffed a bag over his head, handcuffed him to a radiator, and repeatedly administered electric shocks to his ears, nose, and genitals. See People v. Wilson, 506 N.E.2d 571 (Ill. 1987). Burge eventually lost his job with the police, though not until 1992. See In the Matter of the Charges Filed Against Jon Burge, No. 91-1856 (Chicago Police Board, February 11, 1993). To this day, Burge has not been prosecuted for any of these actions, though it appears that he at least thinks that he may still be at some risk of prosecution. See, for example, 118 ""Cop brutality probe must be thorough, fair,"" Chi. Sun-Times, May 16, 2002 (editorial); Hal Dardick, ""Burge repeatedly takes 5th; Former police commander stays mum on torture questions,"" Chi. Tribune, Sept. 2, 2004 (noting allegations that Burge or people reporting to him had tortured 108 Black and Latino suspects between August 1972 and September 1991). . . . Behavior like that attributed to Burge imposes a huge cost on society: it creates distrust of the police generally, despite the fact that most police officers would abhor such tactics, and it creates a cloud over even the valid convictions in which the problem officer played a role. Indeed, the alleged conduct is so extreme that, if proven, it would fall within the prohibitions established by the United Nations Convention Against Torture (""CAT""), which defines torture as ""any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession . . .,"" thereby violating the fundamental human rights principles that the United States is committed to uphold. . . .Embed",en

Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie  [Verse 1: Eminem] I can't tell you what it really is, I can only tell you what it feels like And right now, there's a steel knife in my windpipe I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight High off her love, drunk from her hate It's like I'm huffin' paint and I love her, the more I suffer, I suffocate And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates me She fuckin' hates me, and I love it — ""Wait! Where you going?"" — ""I'm leaving you!"" — ""No, you ain't! Come back!"" — We're runnin' right back, here we go again It's so insane, 'cause when it's goin' good, it's goin' great I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane But when it's bad, it's awful, I feel so ashamed I snapped, ""Who's that dude?"", I don't even know his name I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again I guess I don't know my own strength  [Chorus: Rihanna] Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?

Ni**as in Paris,Jay Z Kanye West,6,2011,"3 ContributorsHot Rap Songs Chart 25th Anniversary: Top 100 Songs LyricsTo honor the 25th anniversary of Billboard's Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the tally's top 100 tracks ever  Rap is a victorious genre. Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture  So it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential ""Yo! MTV Raps"" was only a few months old, and acts like Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation  While rap has evolved, there’s no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard’s Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the top 100 songs in the tally’s quarter-century history. From Salt-N-Pepa to Macklemore, we've got the genre's past quarter-century covered  100. ""All of the Lights"" - Kanye West 99. ""No Lie"" - 2 Chainz feat. Drake 98.

Tonight Is The Night,Outasight,61,2011,"1 ContributorThe Pickwick Papers (Chap. 41) LyricsWhat Befell Mr. Pickwick When He Got Into The Fleet; What  Prisoners He Saw There, And How He Passed The Night Mr. Tom Roker, the gentleman who had accompanied Mr. Pickwick into the prison, turned sharp round to the right when he got to the bottom of the little flight of steps, and led the way, through an iron gate which stood open, and up another short flight of steps, into a long narrow gallery, dirty and low, paved with stone, and very dimly lighted by a window at each remote end.  'This,' said the gentleman, thrusting his hands into his pockets, and looking carelessly over his shoulder to Mr. Pickwick—'this here is the hall flight.' 'Oh,' replied Mr. Pickwick, looking down a dark and filthy staircase, which appeared to lead to a range of damp and gloomy stone vaults, beneath the ground, 'and those, I suppose, are the little cellars where the prisoners keep their small quantities of coals. Unpleasant places to have to go down to; but very convenient, I dare say.'  'Yes, I shouldn't wonder if they was convenient,' replied the gentleman, 'seeing that a few people live there, pretty snug. That's the Fair, that is.'  'My friend,' said Mr. Pickwick, 'you don't really mean to say that human beings live down in those wretched dungeons?'  'Don't I?' replied Mr. Roker, with indignant astonishment; 'why shouldn't I?' 'Live!—live down there!' exclaimed Mr. Pickwick.  'Live down there! Yes, and die down there, too, very often!' replied Mr. Roker; 'and what of that? Who's got to say anything agin it? Live down there! Yes, and a wery good place it is to live in, ain't it?'  As Roker turned somewhat fiercely upon Mr. Pickwick in saying this, and moreover muttered in an excited fashion certain unpleasant invocations concerning his own eyes, limbs, and circulating fluids, the latter gentleman deemed it advisable to pursue the discourse no further. Mr. Roker then proceeded to mount another staircase, as dirty as that which led to the place which has just been the subject of discussion, in which ascent he was closely followed by Mr. Pickwick and Sam.  'There,' said Mr. Roker, pausing for breath when they reached another gallery of the same dimensions as the one below, 'this is the coffee-room flight; the one above's the third, and the one above that's the top; and the room where you're a-going to sleep to-night is the warden's room, and it's this way—come on.' Having said all this in a breath, Mr. Roker mounted another flight of stairs with Mr. Pickwick and Sam Weller following at his heels.  These staircases received light from sundry windows placed at some little distance above the floor, and looking into a gravelled area bounded by a high brick wall, with iron CHEVAUX-DE-FRISE at the top. This area, it appeared from Mr. Roker's statement, was the racket-ground; and it further appeared, on the testimony of the same gentleman, that there was a smaller area in that portion of the prison which was nearest Farringdon Street, denominated and called 'the Painted Ground,' from the fact of its walls having once displayed the semblance of various men-of-war in full sail, and other artistical effects achieved in bygone times by some imprisoned draughtsman in his leisure hours.  Having communicated this piece of information, apparently more for the purpose of discharging his bosom of an important fact, than with any specific view of enlightening Mr. Pickwick, the guide, having at length reached another gallery, led the way into a small passage at the extreme end, opened a door, and disclosed an apartment of an appearance by no means inviting, containing eight or nine iron bedsteads. 'There,' said Mr. Roker, holding the door open, and looking triumphantly round at Mr. Pickwick, 'there's a room!' Mr. Pickwick's face, however, betokened such a very trifling portion of satisfaction at the appearance of his lodging, that Mr. Roker looked, for a reciprocity of feeling, into the countenance of Samuel Weller, who, until now, had observed a dignified silence. 'There's a room, young man,' observed Mr. Roker.  'I see it,' replied Sam, with a placid nod of the head. 'You wouldn't think to find such a room as this in the Farringdon Hotel, would you?' said Mr. Roker, with a complacent smile.  To this Mr. Weller replied with an easy and unstudied closing of one eye; which might be considered to mean, either that he would have thought it, or that he would not have thought it, or that he had never thought anything at all about it, as the observer's imagination suggested. Having executed this feat, and reopened his eye, Mr. Weller proceeded to inquire which was the individual bedstead that Mr. Roker had so flatteringly described as an out-and-outer to sleep in.  'That's it,' replied Mr. Roker, pointing to a very rusty one in a corner. 'It would make any one go to sleep, that bedstead would, whether they wanted to or not.' 'I should think,' said Sam, eyeing the piece of furniture in question with a look of excessive disgust—'I should think poppies was nothing to it.' 'Nothing at all,' said Mr. Roker.  'And I s'pose,' said Sam, with a sidelong glance at his master, as if to see whether there were any symptoms of his determination being shaken by what passed, 'I s'pose the other gen'l'men as sleeps here ARE gen'l'men.' 'Nothing but it,' said Mr. Roker. 'One of 'em takes his twelve pints of ale a day, and never leaves off smoking even at his meals.' 'He must be a first-rater,' said Sam. 'A1,' replied Mr. Roker.  Nothing daunted, even by this intelligence, Mr. Pickwick smilingly announced his determination to test the powers of the narcotic bedstead for that night; and Mr. Roker, after informing him that he could retire to rest at whatever hour he thought proper, without any further notice or formality, walked off, leaving him standing with Sam in the gallery.  It was getting dark; that is to say, a few gas jets were kindled in this place which was never light, by way of compliment to the evening, which had set in outside. As it was rather warm, some of the tenants of the numerous little rooms which opened into the gallery on either hand, had set their doors ajar. Mr. Pickwick peeped into them as he passed along, with great curiosity and interest. Here, four or five great hulking fellows, just visible through a cloud of tobacco smoke, were engaged in noisy and riotous conversation over half-emptied pots of beer, or playing at all-fours with a very greasy pack of cards. In the adjoining room, some solitary tenant might be seen poring, by the light of a feeble tallow candle, over a bundle of soiled and tattered papers, yellow with dust and dropping to pieces from age, writing, for the hundredth time, some lengthened statement of his grievances, for the perusal of some great man whose eyes it would never reach, or whose heart it would never touch. In a third, a man, with his wife and a whole crowd of children, might be seen making up a scanty bed on the ground, or upon a few chairs, for the younger ones to pass the night in. And in a fourth, and a fifth, and a sixth, and a seventh, the noise, and the beer, and the tobacco smoke, and the cards, all came over again in greater force than before.  In the galleries themselves, and more especially on the stair-cases, there lingered a great number of people, who came there, some because their rooms were empty and lonesome, others because their rooms were full and hot; the greater part because they were restless and uncomfortable, and not possessed of the secret of exactly knowing what to do with themselves. There were many classes of people here, from the labouring man in his fustian jacket, to the broken-down spendthrift in his shawl dressing-gown, most appropriately out at elbows; but there was the same air about them all—a kind of listless, jail-bird, careless swagger, a vagabondish who's-afraid sort of bearing, which is wholly indescribable in words, but which any man can understand in one moment if he wish, by setting foot in the nearest debtors' prison, and looking at the very first group of people he sees there, with the same interest as Mr. Pickwick did.  'It strikes me, Sam,' said Mr. Pickwick, leaning over the iron rail at the stair-head-'it strikes me, Sam, that imprisonment for debt is scarcely any punishment at all.' 'Think not, sir?' inquired Mr. Weller.  'You see how these fellows drink, and smoke, and roar,' replied Mr. Pickwick. 'It's quite impossible that they can mind it much.' 'Ah, that's just the wery thing, Sir,' rejoined Sam, 'they don't mind it; it's a reg'lar holiday to them—all porter and skittles. It's the t'other vuns as gets done over vith this sort o' thing; them down-hearted fellers as can't svig avay at the beer, nor play at skittles neither; them as vould pay if they could, and gets low by being boxed up. I'll tell you wot it is, sir; them as is always a-idlin' in public-houses it don't damage at all, and them as is alvays a-workin' wen they can, it damages too much. ""It's unekal,"" as my father used to say wen his grog worn't made half-and-half: ""it's unekal, and that's the fault on it.""'  'I think you're right, Sam,' said Mr. Pickwick, after a few moments' reflection, 'quite right.'  'P'raps, now and then, there's some honest people as likes it,' observed Mr. Weller, in a ruminative tone, 'but I never heerd o' one as I can call to mind, 'cept the little dirty-faced man in the brown coat; and that was force of habit.' 'And who was he?' inquired Mr. Pickwick.  'Wy, that's just the wery point as nobody never know'd,' replied Sam. 'But what did he do?'  'Wy, he did wot many men as has been much better know'd has done in their time, Sir,' replied Sam, 'he run a match agin the constable, and vun it.' 'In other words, I suppose,' said Mr. Pickwick, 'he got into debt.'  'Just that, Sir,' replied Sam, 'and in course o' time he come here in consekens. It warn't much—execution for nine pound nothin', multiplied by five for costs; but hows'ever here he stopped for seventeen year. If he got any wrinkles in his face, they were stopped up vith the dirt, for both the dirty face and the brown coat wos just the same at the end o' that time as they wos at the beginnin'. He wos a wery peaceful, inoffendin' little creetur, and wos alvays a-bustlin' about for somebody, or playin' rackets and never vinnin'; till at last the turnkeys they got quite fond on him, and he wos in the lodge ev'ry night, a-chattering vith 'em, and tellin' stories, and all that 'ere. Vun night he wos in there as usual, along vith a wery old friend of his, as wos on the lock, ven he says all of a sudden, ""I ain't seen the market outside, Bill,"" he says (Fleet Market wos there at that time)—""I ain't seen the market outside, Bill,"" he says, ""for seventeen year."" ""I know you ain't,"" says the turnkey, smoking his pipe. ""I should like to see it for a minit, Bill,"" he says. ""Wery probable,"" says the turnkey, smoking his pipe wery fierce, and making believe he warn't up to wot the little man wanted. ""Bill,"" says the little man, more abrupt than afore, ""I've got the fancy in my head. Let me see the public streets once more afore I die; and if I ain't struck with apoplexy, I'll be back in five minits by the clock."" ""And wot 'ud become o' me if you WOS struck with apoplexy?"" said the turnkey. ""Wy,"" says the little creetur, ""whoever found me, 'ud bring me home, for I've got my card in my pocket, Bill,"" he says, ""No. 20, Coffee-room Flight"": and that wos true, sure enough, for wen he wanted to make the acquaintance of any new-comer, he used to pull out a little limp card vith them words on it and nothin' else; in consideration of vich, he vos alvays called Number Tventy. The turnkey takes a fixed look at him, and at last he says in a solemn manner, ""Tventy,"" he says, ""I'll trust you; you Won't get your old friend into trouble."" ""No, my boy; I hope I've somethin' better behind here,"" says the little man; and as he said it he hit his little vesket wery hard, and then a tear started out o' each eye, which wos wery extraordinary, for it wos supposed as water never touched his face. He shook the turnkey by the hand; out he vent—'  'And never came back again,' said Mr. Pickwick. 'Wrong for vunce, sir,' replied Mr. Weller, 'for back he come, two minits afore the time, a-bilin' with rage, sayin' how he'd been nearly run over by a hackney-coach that he warn't used to it; and he was blowed if he wouldn't write to the lord mayor. They got him pacified at last; and for five years arter that, he never even so much as peeped out o' the lodge gate.'  'At the expiration of that time he died, I suppose,' said Mr. Pickwick. 'No, he didn't, Sir,' replied Sam. 'He got a curiosity to go and taste the beer at a new public-house over the way, and it wos such a wery nice parlour, that he took it into his head to go there every night, which he did for a long time, always comin' back reg'lar about a quarter of an hour afore the gate shut, which was all wery snug and comfortable. At last he began to get so precious jolly, that he used to forget how the time vent, or care nothin' at all about it, and he went on gettin' later and later, till vun night his old friend wos just a-shuttin' the gate—had turned the key in fact—wen he come up. ""Hold hard, Bill,"" he says. ""Wot, ain't you come home yet, Tventy?"" says the turnkey, ""I thought you wos in, long ago."" ""No, I wasn't,"" says the little man, with a smile. ""Well, then, I'll tell you wot it is, my friend,"" says the turnkey, openin' the gate wery slow and sulky, ""it's my 'pinion as you've got into bad company o' late, which I'm wery sorry to see. Now, I don't wish to do nothing harsh,"" he says, ""but if you can't confine yourself to steady circles, and find your vay back at reg'lar hours, as sure as you're a-standin' there, I'll shut you out altogether!"" The little man was seized vith a wiolent fit o' tremblin', and never vent outside the prison walls artervards!'  As Sam concluded, Mr. Pickwick slowly retraced his steps downstairs. After a few thoughtful turns in the Painted Ground, which, as it was now dark, was nearly deserted, he intimated to Mr. Weller that he thought it high time for him to withdraw for the night; requesting him to seek a bed in some adjacent public-house, and return early in the morning, to make arrangements for the removal of his master's wardrobe from the George and Vulture. This request Mr. Samuel Weller prepared to obey, with as good a grace as he could assume, but with a very considerable show of reluctance nevertheless. He even went so far as to essay sundry ineffectual hints regarding the expediency of stretching himself on the gravel for that night; but finding Mr. Pickwick obstinately deaf to any such suggestions, finally withdrew.  There is no disguising the fact that Mr. Pickwick felt very low-spirited and uncomfortable—not for lack of society, for the prison was very full, and a bottle of wine would at once have purchased the utmost good-fellowship of a few choice spirits, without any more formal ceremony of introduction; but he was alone in the coarse, vulgar crowd, and felt the depression of spirits and sinking of heart, naturally consequent on the reflection that he was cooped and caged up, without a prospect of liberation. As to the idea of releasing himself by ministering to the sharpness of Dodson & Fogg, it never for an instant entered his thoughts.  In this frame of mind he turned again into the coffee-room gallery, and walked slowly to and fro. The place was intolerably dirty, and the smell of tobacco smoke perfectly suffocating. There was a perpetual slamming and banging of doors as the people went in and out; and the noise of their voices and footsteps echoed and re-echoed through the passages constantly. A young woman, with a child in her arms, who seemed scarcely able to crawl, from emaciation and misery, was walking up and down the passage in conversation with her husband, who had no other place to see her in. As they passed Mr. Pickwick, he could hear the female sob bitterly; and once she burst into such a passion of grief, that she was compelled to lean against the wall for support, while the man took the child in his arms, and tried to soothe her. Mr. Pickwick's heart was really too full to bear it, and he went upstairs to bed. Now, although the warder's room was a very uncomfortable one (being, in every point of decoration and convenience, several hundred degrees inferior to the common infirmary of a county jail), it had at present the merit of being wholly deserted save by Mr. Pickwick himself. So, he sat down at the foot of his little iron bedstead, and began to wonder how much a year the warder made out of the dirty room. Having satisfied himself, by mathematical calculation, that the apartment was about equal in annual value to the freehold of a small street in the suburbs of London, he took to wondering what possible temptation could have induced a dingy-looking fly that was crawling over his pantaloons, to come into a close prison, when he had the choice of so many airy situations—a course of meditation which led him to the irresistible conclusion that the insect was insane. After settling this point, he began to be conscious that he was getting sleepy; whereupon he took his nightcap out of the pocket in which he had had the precaution to stow it in the morning, and, leisurely undressing himself, got into bed and fell asleep.  'Bravo! Heel over toe—cut and shuffle—pay away at it, Zephyr! I'm smothered if the opera house isn't your proper hemisphere. Keep it up! Hooray!' These expressions, delivered in a most boisterous tone, and accompanied with loud peals of laughter, roused Mr. Pickwick from one of those sound slumbers which, lasting in reality some half-hour, seem to the sleeper to have been protracted for three weeks or a month. The voice had no sooner ceased than the room was shaken with such violence that the windows rattled in their frames, and the bedsteads trembled again. Mr. Pickwick started up, and remained for some minutes fixed in mute astonishment at the scene before him.  On the floor of the room, a man in a broad-skirted green coat, with corduroy knee-smalls and gray cotton stockings, was performing the most popular steps of a hornpipe, with a slang and burlesque caricature of grace and lightness, which, combined with the very appropriate character of his costume, was inexpressibly absurd. Another man, evidently very drunk, who had probably been tumbled into bed by his companions, was sitting up between the sheets, warbling as much as he could recollect of a comic song, with the most intensely sentimental feeling and expression; while a third, seated on one of the bedsteads, was applauding both performers with the air of a profound connoisseur, and encouraging them by such ebullitions of feeling as had already roused Mr. Pickwick from his sleep.  This last man was an admirable specimen of a class of gentry which never can be seen in full perfection but in such places—they may be met with, in an imperfect state, occasionally about stable-yards and Public-houses; but they never attain their full bloom except in these hot-beds, which would almost seem to be considerately provided by the legislature for the sole purpose of rearing them.  He was a tall fellow, with an olive complexion, long dark hair, and very thick bushy whiskers meeting under his chin. He wore no neckerchief, as he had been playing rackets all day, and his Open shirt collar displayed their full luxuriance. On his head he wore one of the common eighteenpenny French skull-caps, with a gaudy tassel dangling therefrom, very happily in keeping with a common fustian coat. His legs, which, being long, were afflicted with weakness, graced a pair of Oxford-mixture trousers, made to show the full symmetry of those limbs. Being somewhat negligently braced, however, and, moreover, but imperfectly buttoned, they fell in a series of not the most graceful folds over a pair of shoes sufficiently down at heel to display a pair of very soiled white stockings. There was a rakish, vagabond smartness, and a kind of boastful rascality, about the whole man, that was worth a mine of gold.  This figure was the first to perceive that Mr. Pickwick was looking on; upon which he winked to the Zephyr, and entreated him, with mock gravity, not to wake the gentleman. 'Why, bless the gentleman's honest heart and soul!' said the Zephyr, turning round and affecting the extremity of surprise; 'the gentleman is awake. Hem, Shakespeare! How do you do, Sir? How is Mary and Sarah, sir? and the dear old lady at home, Sir? Will you have the kindness to put my compliments into the first little parcel you're sending that way, sir, and say that I would have sent 'em before, only I was afraid they might be broken in the wagon, sir?'  'Don't overwhelm the gentlemen with ordinary civilities when you see he's anxious to have something to drink,' said the gentleman with the whiskers, with a jocose air. 'Why don't you ask the gentleman what he'll take?'  'Dear me, I quite forgot,' replied the other. 'What will you take, sir? Will you take port wine, sir, or sherry wine, sir? I can recommend the ale, sir; or perhaps you'd like to taste the porter, sir? Allow me to have the felicity of hanging up your nightcap, Sir.' With this, the speaker snatched that article of dress from Mr. Pickwick's head, and fixed it in a twinkling on that of the drunken man, who, firmly impressed with the belief that he was delighting a numerous assembly, continued to hammer away at the comic song in the most melancholy strains imaginable.  Taking a man's nightcap from his brow by violent means, and adjusting it on the head of an unknown gentleman, of dirty exterior, however ingenious a witticism in itself, is unquestionably one of those which come under the denomination of practical jokes. Viewing the matter precisely in this light, Mr. Pickwick, without the slightest intimation of his purpose, sprang vigorously out of bed, struck the Zephyr so smart a blow in the chest as to deprive him of a considerable portion of the commodity which sometimes bears his name, and then, recapturing his nightcap, boldly placed himself in an attitude of defence.  'Now,' said Mr. Pickwick, gasping no less from excitement than from the expenditure of so much energy, 'come on—both of you—both of you!' With this liberal invitation the worthy gentleman communicated a revolving motion to his clenched fists, by way of appalling his antagonists with a display of science.  It might have been Mr. Pickwick's very unexpected gallantry, or it might have been the complicated manner in which he had got himself out of bed, and fallen all in a mass upon the hornpipe man, that touched his adversaries. Touched they were; for, instead of then and there making an attempt to commit man-slaughter, as Mr. Pickwick implicitly believed they would have done, they paused, stared at each other a short time, and finally laughed outright.  'Well, you're a trump, and I like you all the better for it,' said the Zephyr. 'Now jump into bed again, or you'll catch the rheumatics. No malice, I hope?' said the man, extending a hand the size of the yellow clump of fingers which sometimes swings over a glover's door.  'Certainly not,' said Mr. Pickwick, with great alacrity; for, now that the excitement was over, he began to feel rather cool about the legs.  'Allow me the H-onour,' said the gentleman with the whiskers, presenting his dexter hand, and aspirating the h.  'With much pleasure, sir,' said Mr. Pickwick; and having executed a very long and solemn shake, he got into bed again.  'My name is Smangle, sir,' said the man with the whiskers. 'Oh,' said Mr. Pickwick.  'Mine is Mivins,' said the man in the stockings. 'I am delighted to hear it, sir,' said Mr. Pickwick. 'Hem,' coughed Mr. Smangle. 'Did you speak, sir?' said Mr. Pickwick. 'No, I did not, sir,' said Mr. Smangle. All this was very genteel and pleasant; and, to make matters still more comfortable, Mr. Smangle assured Mr. Pickwick a great many more times that he entertained a very high respect for the feelings of a gentleman; which sentiment, indeed, did him infinite credit, as he could be in no wise supposed to understand them.  'Are you going through the court, sir?' inquired Mr. Smangle. 'Through the what?' said Mr. Pickwick.  'Through the court—Portugal Street—the Court for Relief of—You know.' 'Oh, no,' replied Mr. Pickwick. 'No, I am not.' 'Going out, perhaps?' suggested Mr. Mivins. 'I fear not,' replied Mr. Pickwick. 'I refuse to pay some damages, and am here in consequence.'  'Ah,' said Mr. Smangle, 'paper has been my ruin.' 'A stationer, I presume, Sir?' said Mr. Pickwick innocently. 'Stationer! No, no; confound and curse me! Not so low as that. No trade. When I say paper, I mean bills.'  'Oh, you use the word in that sense. I see,' said Mr. Pickwick. 'Damme! A gentleman must expect reverses,' said Smangle. 'What of that? Here am I in the Fleet Prison. Well; good. What then? I'm none the worse for that, am I?'  'Not a bit,' replied Mr. Mivins. And he was quite right; for, so far from Mr. Smangle being any the worse for it, he was something the better, inasmuch as to qualify himself for the place, he had attained gratuitous possession of certain articles of jewellery, which, long before that, had found their way to the pawnbroker's.  'Well; but come,' said Mr. Smangle; 'this is dry work. Let's rinse our mouths with a drop of burnt sherry; the last-comer shall stand it, Mivins shall fetch it, and I'll help to drink it. That's a fair and gentlemanlike division of labour, anyhow. Curse me!' Unwilling to hazard another quarrel, Mr. Pickwick gladly assented to the proposition, and consigned the money to Mr. Mivins, who, as it was nearly eleven o'clock, lost no time in repairing to the coffee-room on his errand.  'I say,' whispered Smangle, the moment his friend had left the room; 'what did you give him?' 'Half a sovereign,' said Mr. Pickwick. 'He's a devilish pleasant gentlemanly dog,' said Mr. Smangle;—'infernal pleasant. I don't know anybody more so; but—' Here Mr. Smangle stopped short, and shook his head dubiously.  'You don't think there is any probability of his appropriating the money to his own use?' said Mr. Pickwick.  'Oh, no! Mind, I don't say that; I expressly say that he's a devilish gentlemanly fellow,' said Mr. Smangle. 'But I think, perhaps, if somebody went down, just to see that he didn't dip his beak into the jug by accident, or make some confounded mistake in losing the money as he came upstairs, it would be as well. Here, you sir, just run downstairs, and look after that gentleman, will you?'  This request was addressed to a little timid-looking, nervous man, whose appearance bespoke great poverty, and who had been crouching on his bedstead all this while, apparently stupefied by the novelty of his situation.  'You know where the coffee-room is,' said Smangle; 'just run down, and tell that gentleman you've come to help him up with the jug. Or—stop—I'll tell you what—I'll tell you how we'll do him,' said Smangle, with a cunning look. 'How?' said Mr. Pickwick.  'Send down word that he's to spend the change in cigars. Capital thought. Run and tell him that; d'ye hear? They shan't be wasted,' continued Smangle, turning to Mr. Pickwick. 'I'LL smoke 'em.'  This manoeuvring was so exceedingly ingenious and, withal, performed with such immovable composure and coolness, that Mr. Pickwick would have had no wish to disturb it, even if he had had the power. In a short time Mr. Mivins returned, bearing the sherry, which Mr. Smangle dispensed in two little cracked mugs; considerately remarking, with reference to himself, that a gentleman must not be particular under such circumstances, and that, for his part, he was not too proud to drink out of the jug. In which, to show his sincerity, he forthwith pledged the company in a draught which half emptied it.  An excellent understanding having been by these means promoted, Mr. Smangle proceeded to entertain his hearers with a relation of divers romantic adventures in which he had been from time to time engaged, involving various interesting anecdotes of a thoroughbred horse, and a magnificent Jewess, both of surpassing beauty, and much coveted by the nobility and gentry of these kingdoms.  Long before these elegant extracts from the biography of a gentleman were concluded, Mr. Mivins had betaken himself to bed, and had set in snoring for the night, leaving the timid stranger and Mr. Pickwick to the full benefit of Mr. Smangle's experiences.  Nor were the two last-named gentlemen as much edified as they might have been by the moving passages narrated. Mr. Pickwick had been in a state of slumber for some time, when he had a faint perception of the drunken man bursting out afresh with the comic song, and receiving from Mr. Smangle a gentle intimation, through the medium of the water-jug, that his audience was not musically disposed. Mr. Pickwick then once again dropped off to sleep, with a confused consciousness that Mr. Smangle was still engaged in relating a long story, the chief point of which appeared to be that, on some occasion particularly stated and set forth, he had 'done' a bill and a gentleman at the same time.Embed",en

Cruise,Florida Georgia Line Featuring Nelly,22,2012,"2 ContributorsTurn Up for Hick Hop? Lyrics""The mixtape's got a little Hank, little Drake""  So says country superstar duo Florida Georgia Line in their smash single from the spring of 2014, “This Is How We Roll.”  This is not just an empty boast, either.  Listen to the second verse while perhaps imagining Drake as a white, Southern, bro-country artist:  ""Up on them 37 Nittos, windows tinted hard to see though [...] Them kisses are for me though, automatic like a free throw This life I live it might not be for you, but it's for me though""  Not only is the rhetoric Drake worthy – extolling the virtues of a uniquely superior lifestyle - but the way he rhymes “though” using a slang pronunciation three times in close succession, why, it even sounds like Drake!  On another track, their “Cruise Remix” video featuring Nelly, Florida Georgia Line also supply imagery indicative of their genre-blending.  While some rap music has long been short-sightedly accused of focusing on cash, cars, drugs, and women, FGL show that this is redneck thematic territory as well; just observe the expensive rides and seductively southern dames:Likewise, through artful alliteration, the boys name-drop their party drink as well:  ""She was sippin' on Southern and singin' Marshall Tucker""  And this is all before we get to Nelly’s impassioned verse, which he contributes, according to the video’s opening scene, to help them learn how to “turn up.”  Judging by “This Is How We Roll” as a follow-up, it is obvious FGL have learned the lesson well –- so well that they have been influenced even by the structure of Hip-Hop, bringing in one of their homies for a guest verse: Luke Bryan, himself known to get turnt by mixing a little Conway with some T-Pain every once in a while. Some people, though, are instead turning this trend down. While peeping their video on YouTube reveals over 16 million views (as of 7/17/14), the comments section is filled with vitriolic rants.  One such comment puts it this way: “Hick-Hop. Manufactured, lame, corporate horse crap. This is a disgrace to country music. Johnny Cash is rolling over in his grave right now.” Really? The same Johnny Cash who was the OG Southern thug!  The same Johnny Cash who put so much conviction into singing lines like:  ""I took a shot of cocaine and I shot my woman down"" ""When I was arrested I was dressed in black""  ""I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die"" We’re talking the “Man In Black” himself!  I think he’d welcome the chance, were he still alive, to pal around with some new school gangsters, and, presented with an opportunity for a remix, would probably choose to turn up instead of turn it down!9Embed",en

Bad Things,Machine Gun Kelly x Camila Cabello,14,2016,"1 ContributorCamila Cabello Talks Solo Music, Life After Fifth Harmony LyricsCABELLO KICKED OFF HER SOLO CAREER AND HER BAND SISTERS IN FIFTH HARMONY UNEXPECTEDLY DENOUNCED HER FOR IT. NOW SHE’S GOT A TOP FIVE SINGLE, A MUCH-ANTICIPATED ALBUM COMING AND ZERO SECOND THOUGHTS: “YOU HAVE TO HONOR THAT INNER VOICE”.  CAMILA CABELLO IS LATE FOR BRUNCH. But not sullen, rock-star, hiding-behind-shades late. More like 19-year-old, mixed-up-the-address late. She’s running through the dining room of Versailles, a Cuban restaurant deep in Los Angeles’ San Fernando Valley, lush black hair streaming, apologies pouring forth, having just rushed from the other Versailles, in the city’s center.  As soon as she sits on this mid-January Sunday morning, flashing that disarmingly broad smile, the singer — who was born in Cuba, resides in Miami and is staying in an Airbnb here in town — says, “I’ve got you on what we’re going to eat.” She then proceeds to order, in rapid-fire Spanish, a bounty of food: lemonades, steaks, rice, beans, plantains, croquettes, flan.  Confusion, stress, the promise of a splendid feast: That has pretty much been the story of Cabello’s recent life. It was only a month before this weekend that she was still a member of Fifth Harmony, the most successful girl group since Destiny's Child, with more than 7 million digital songs sold, according to Nielsen Music.  Before the year was out, she was a solo artist weathering accusations from her bandmates (namely, that she quit through her representatives after dodging a series of label interventions and therapy sessions) and even hate-tweets from zealous fans (see: #CamilaIsOverParty).  But that’s the confusion and stress. During that same time, Cabello had plenty to celebrate. The singer, who had collaborated outside of 5H for some time, released the darkly sexy rap-romp single “Bad Things” with Machine Gun Kelly last October, and it climbed the charts. (It’s now No. 1 on the Mainstream Top 40 Chart.) And that’s not even her first hit: “I Know What You Did Last Summer,” her 2015 duet with Shawn Mendes, peaked at No. 20 on the Billboard Hot 100.  She has social numbers to rival the band’s (3.4 million to 5H’s 3.8 million on Twitter and 8.8 million to 8.2 million on Instagram), a guest turn on a Major Lazer song banked and enough studio time booked to successfully capitalize on what seems, in retrospect, like an inevitable transition to solo stardom.  “It would take a big force to stop her from taking over the world,” says her friend Mendes, adding, “She was such a great writing partner. I barely had to speak and she knew exactly what I meant.”  But Cabello, whose album is due this fall, already had fame, fortune and obsessive fans. The true gift, after five years of nonstop touring, recording and meet-and-greets with 5H, is the taste of freedom.  “You know that quote, ‘In the silence, you find God?’ ” asks Cabello, who — in her lace choker, a holey white tee and a black marching band coat — looks like the petite (she’s 5-foot-2) commander of some fun and fashionable army. “I felt like I could hear everything my heart was telling me.”  The heart, of course, can be an unreliable guide, and by going solo Cabello is risking more than the slings and arrows of unhappy Harmonizers. (5H fans — who easily overrun fan polls, like the one for the MTV Video Music Awards’ 2016 Song of the Summer contest, in which “Work From Home” crushed massive songs by Calvin Harris and Drake — are not to be underestimated.)  Only one woman has recently left a girl group for a colossal solo career, and she’s not an ordinary human: She’s Beyoncé.  The closer models for Cabello may be her fellow talent-show contestants in One Direction. But none of their trajectories will quite work for a woman who has to, as it seems all young female pop stars must, thread the wholesome-and-sexy needle. Zayn Malik disavowed his past, graffitied his home, cloistered himself in a weed cloud and took his sweet time on an album, all of which only made him cooler.  Niall Horan took a backpacking trip, rediscovered the ’70s folk-rock of his youth and launched a career as a troubadour, which just made him dreamier.  Harry Styles is already considered a rock star without having sung a solo note.  Cabello, lest she be judged, must be seductive but pure of heart, strong but vulnerable, self-possessed but not selfish. In a way, girl-group rules still apply.  But that hasn’t stopped her from building on her momentum, and not just by hitting the studio and bringing “Bad Things” to The Ellen DeGeneres Show with Machine Gun Kelly in January (her first post-5H TV appearance, a month after Fifth Harmony’s final televised performance).  She has also carefully cultivated her public voice, telling Lena Dunham in a Lenny interview before Donald Trump’s inauguration: “I’m going to stick up for immigrants, and I’m going to stick up for Hispanic people and their rights.”  After Trump issued his immigration order, she tweeted, “the #MuslimBan is dehumanizing beyond words... im in shock. THIS IS NOT WHO WE ARE.”  “The easiest route would be to shut my mouth, sing the songs, wear the clothes and keep going, you know?” says Cabello with a jittery laugh, weighing life in 5H against going it alone.  “I mean, [we were] at the peak of our career. It’s definitely not the safe option.” But, she says, “I have it in my DNA. The way my mom raised me, it has always been: Don’t settle. Jump and hope you grow wings on the way down.” She flings her arms like she’s on a roller coaster. “I feel alive!”  The lyrics analysis site Genius recently determined that Cabello sang on nearly 45 percent of all the lines in Fifth Harmony’s songs. Even when she was doing the most inside the group, Cabello was doing the most outside it, too. She started writing on her own early in 5H’s career, despite the grueling schedule.  Her friend Taylor Swift’s Red inspired her to make “sonic photographs” of her changing life, so when she wasn’t cutting parts for 5H’s 2013 Better Together EP at Hollywood’s Record Plant, she would be in the studio’s gym, writing lyrics over other artists’ melodies about things like “my first kiss and my first boyfriend.” Then she got GarageBand and a MIDI keyboard, and began churning out “shitty demos” while touring malls and, in time, arenas.  “I would wake up super early,” says Cabello, “get off the bus, go to the hotel, put the TV on super loud — I didn’t want people to hear me f—ing yelling — then go into the bathroom, put my laptop on the toilet and sit on the floor and write all day.”  So she was basically singing into the toilet? “Yep.”  “She has done her 10,000 hours,” says Cabello’s manager Roger Gold, co-founder of 300 Entertainment. “Fifth Harmony worked incredibly hard 11-and-a-half months of the year. It was an incredible school.”  But when it finally came time for Cabello to go solo, bitter, previously unhinted-at feelings erupted in a shockingly public way.  When I ask her about it, Cabello doesn’t shy away from discussing the drama of late December 2016, although she clearly means to take the high road:  *When did the relationship between you and the group start to change?*  I don’t know. I was always super open [that] I couldn’t just sing other people’s words and be totally happy with that. You have to follow and honor that inner voice. I always encouraged the girls to do the same.  *Do you feel like that changed the relationship, your asserting that?*  I think that in a group there is always going to be tension, whether it’s because of this thing or [another] thing. Obviously, I think that rocked the boat.  *Have you been in touch with anyone in 5H since all that went down?*  No.  *Have you reached out directly?* I did, yeah. I don’t want to get into the details of that, because it was really intense and it’s hard for me to talk about. It makes me sad.  *When I first heard you were going solo, I was like, “I’m sure there are no hard feelings because this isn’t a surprise.” Then I was like, “What’s happening?”*  I had the same reaction. I hoped that it would be a peaceful turning of the page and we would root for each other. But I only got love for them. Cabello took her first vacation in five years on Christmas, after her mother, Sinuhe, insisted she unplug with the family (including her dad, Alejandro, and 9-year-old sister, Sofia) for three weeks in Cancún.  “The first four days were trippy,” says Cabello. “I was stressing about not stressing about something. Sometimes you’re afraid of the quiet. Like, go, go, go!”  Cabello was raised in Havana and, later, Mexico City. When she was 6, her folks told her they were going to Disney World. Instead, Camila and Sinu (as she’s called) emigrated legally from Mexico, spent a day in holding, took a 36-hour bus ride to Miami and moved in with a friend.  Alejandro was forced to stay behind, but after a year-and-a-half of heartache, he got fed up and took the risk of crossing over. Sinu was an architect in Cuba but found work at a Marshalls, stocking shoes. Alejandro, when he arrived, washed cars at the mall. Today, they have a successful contracting company.  “My parents worked really hard,” says Cabello. “We always had periods where my dad would be out of a job. It was a constant flow of having money, losing everything and then finding a way to get it again. If we had food to eat, a roof over our heads and I was going to school, that was enough.”  (Alejandro finally got his visa in 2016, and Cabello sent her parents to Jamaica on the honeymoon they had never had.)  Cabello’s Florida friends, who all predate her appearance on The X Factor, reconnected for “Friendsgiving” in 2016 and FaceTimed an eighth-grade theater teacher who encouraged Cabello when she first got into acting and singing.  She’s not much for going out: “I had a phase in Miami where I was like, ‘I’m going to do all the things I would do if I were 19,’ ” which she is. “I went [to clubs], and I was like, ‘I don’t love this.’ ”  After our brunch in Los Angeles, she plans to meet Troye Sivan for coffee and then have him and Swift over to her Silver Lake Airbnb for some “chill stuff.”  Mainly, Cabello’s focused on making music.  Even her hobbies serve the cause. For song ideas she mines poetry (the book Milk and Honey, by young feminist Rupi Kaur, made her cry), novels (currently: Love in the Time of Cholera by Gabriel García Márquez), movies (her favorites include The Notebook, Titanic, Romeo + Juliet and, above all, the 2001 rom-com Serendipity) and inspirational quotes she finds on Tumblr.  She also enjoys practicing guitar — 5H player and “super close friend” Ashlee Juno gave her daily lessons on the group’s 7/27 Tour in 2016.  Romantically speaking, says Cabello, “I don’t have anything going on right now,” although she does let slip that “literally every boy I’ve liked has been a Scorpio.” (Rumormongers, take note: Mendes is a Leo.)  And when we start talking about La La Land, she winds up telling an unbelievable story:  “I love the movie because I’m such a hopeless romantic. It made me feel like I could meet anybody anywhere. Like, yesterday I asked my Uber driver for his number. Because we were actually talking about the movie and he was like, ‘I just came out of a relationship.’ He just sounded like he was a hopeless romantic. And I was like, ‘You know what? I’ll get his number.’ He never texted me back.” What? “I don’t know. Maybe it didn’t go through.”  A few weeks after our brunch, in early February, Cabello’s in the booth at Sphere Studios in Los Angeles, laptop out and Notes app open, singing from a file called “It’s Only Natural” using her achiest coo and a slight patois: “It’s only natural, I need some love from you/I might pull up on you/It’s only human to, wanna do da tings we do.” The vocal is balmy and bright over steel drums and Jack Ü-style edited vocal samples.  “I never underestimated her talent, but I was not expecting her to have such a powerful vision,” says Andrew “Pop” Wansel, who’s known for his work with Kehlani and Alessia Cara, from the control room.  “It’s a real collaboration,” chimes in co-producer Frank Dukes, who has worked with Drake and Travis Scott. “Sometimes it’s like a band just jamming.”  The trio has been honing a handful of songs that skillfully blend Cabello’s love for Rihanna’s ANTI (“I can loop it forever,” she says), the era of R&B-pop that includes Alicia Keys’ 2007 song “No One,” all things Shakira and, of course, Cuban music.  They want to open the LP with a dusty, piano-clanging cut called “Havana” and preview an upbeat Caribbean heater that sounds like Sia planting a flag in “One Dance.”  “Camila is an incredible songwriter,” says Epic Records chairman/CEO Antonio “L.A.” Reid, who (with Simon Cowell) assembled 5H for The X Factor and still has Cabello on his roster. “She is working overtime.”  Cabello’s mom pops into the studio to remind her she has a call in 15 minutes. Sinu isn’t a momager so much as her daughter’s right hand and confidante.  Along with the other members of 5H, she has been by Cabello’s side the entire time, and now she’s the only one left who has seen it all. Fifth Harmony, meanwhile, is soldiering on without Cabello.  Epic plans to release an album from the group in 2017, too, and 5H’s People’s Choice Awards performance of “Work From Home” in January was an unmistakable shoulder-brush, as Fifth Harmony changed the “I” to “We” in Cabello’s opening line, “I ain’t worried about nothing,” and punctuated it with a full stop.  “I know people will try and turn this into, ‘Is she going to be more successful outside the group?’ If I’m growing as an artist, that’s success.”  In April 2016, I interviewed the members of Fifth Harmony for a Billboard cover story, and the chat quickly turned into a tear-drenched airing of grievances about the group’s toll on their private lives. The only one who didn’t cry was Cabello.  “I was like, ‘Oh, my God, this is the saddest thing I’ve ever seen.’ I’m sorry about that,” she tells me this time around.  Cabello wasn’t immune to the pressures, just on the mend, fighting anxiety with journaling, exercise, meditation and music. I remind her what she told me then — that she had recently been afraid of the things her brain might tell her.  “It’s so hard to hear that,” says Cabello, lowering her head. “It breaks my heart. It’s like I’m watching myself from another person’s perspective, like, ‘Damn, poor girl.’ ”  She did finally cry after the turmoil with the group, in Miami with her parents and sister. And then, she says, “I went to the beach a lot. I listened only to Latin music. It reminds me of where I come from and that this [conflict] doesn’t have to be World War III. In Cuba, people are literally making rafts out of tires and sticks, throwing themselves into the ocean to find opportunity. That’s real shit. Not this.  “I know people will try and turn this into, ‘Is she going to be more successful outside the group?’ ” continues Cabello. “To me, if I’m in the studio every day and I’m growing as an artist and I’m speaking from my heart, that’s success. The results don’t matter. I mean, isn’t that the goal?”  If Cabello is anxious now, it doesn’t show. She seems proud of what 5H was — “We represented all different kinds of women coming together,” she says fondly — but is candid about what it wasn’t:  “We didn’t write our records. We were interpreting somebody else’s story. Fifth Harmony is an entity or identity outside all of us, and I don’t think anybody felt individually represented by the sound — we didn’t make it.”Embed",en

Cole] Hey, niggas be dyin' on the daily It seems my dreams faded for far too long The consequences deadly Can't visualize myself as nothin' but a criminal Control the block, servin' up rocks and stay subliminal 'Cause young niggas is hardheaded, they lettin' off Full of adrenaline, ignorant to what death can cause Ain't no comin' back, family dressed in black Plus it's hot now, the cops outside, it's hard to flip a pack And my daughter gotta eat, her mama be stressin' me Like I ain't the one who put them Js on her feet Like I ain't out in the field like that I might be low for the moment but I will bounce back Despite the charges, back to the wall, I fight regardless Screamin', ""Fuck the law,"" my life is lawless That's what you call it, ain't got to be no psychic To see this is like the farthest thing from heaven This is hell and I don't mean that hyperbolic I try to find employment even if it's wipin' toilets But these felonies be makin' life the hardest Resistin' the temptation to run up and swipe a wallet Or run up on your yard, snatch your daughter bike, and pawn it That's why I write this sonnet If the pressure get too much for me to take and I break Play this tape for my daughter and let her know my life is on it (For your eyes) Let her know my life is on it (For your eyes) For your eyes only You might also like[Chorus: J.

Cole] You prolly grown now, so this song'll hit you If you hearin' this, unfortunately means that I'm no longer with you In the physical, not even sure if I believe in God but because you still alive He got me prayin' that the spiritual is real So I can be a part of you still, my pops was killed too So I know how part of you feels Maybe you hate me, maybe you miss me, maybe you spite me Life goes in cycles, maybe you'll date a nigga just like me I hope not, I'm tired of dope spots And fiends that smoke rocks I've seen far too many niggas' hopes rot I'm writin' this because me and the devil had a dance Now I see death around the corner, 'pologizin' in advance Don't know if I ever had a chance At a glance, I'm a failure Addicted to pushin' paraphernalia But daddy had dreams once, my eyes had a gleam once Innocence disappeared by the age of eight years My pops shot up, drug-related, mama addicted So Granny raised me in projects where thugs was hangin' Blood was stainin' the concrete Older niggas I loved, talked like they was above Maintainin' a timesheet, that's slow money Picked up the family business, by the age of thirteen Six years later was handed sentence 'Round the same time is when you came in this world Me and your mama thinkin': ""What the fuck we namin' this girl?"" I told her, ""Nina,"" the prettiest name that I could think of (Most prettiest thing my eyes had ever seen) For the prettiest thing my eyes had ever seen, I was nineteen Took me two felonies to see the trap this crooked-ass system set for me And now I fear it's too late for me to ever be The one that set examples that was never set for me I'm livin' fast, but not fast enough 'Cause karma keeps on catchin' up to me And if my past becomes the death of me I hope you understand [Chorus: J.

Niggas don't know how to act in a drought See, baby girl, I realized my definition of a real nigga was skewed My views misshaped by new mixtapes That confirmed the shit I learned in the streets was true That real niggas don't speak when they beef with you They just pull up on your street, let the heat achoo And if a real nigga hungry, he gon' eat your food I was a fool, spent all my time duckin' school, duckin' cops Duckin' rules, huggin' blocks that don't love you I pray you find a nigga with goals and point of views Much broader than the corner, if not it's gon' corner you Into a box, where your son don't even know his pops And the cyclical nature of doin' time continues My worst fear is one day that you come home from school And see your father face while hearin' 'bout tragedy on news I got the strangest feelin' your daddy gonna lose his life soon And sadly if you're listenin' now it must mean it's true But maybe there's a chance that it's not And this album remains locked in a hard drive like valuable jewels And I can teach you this in person like I'm teachin' you to tie your own shoes I love you and I hope to God I don't lose you For your eyes only [Chorus: CharGaux & J.

At Last,Sundance Head,89,2016,"3 ContributorsThe Way to Rainy Mountain LyricsA single knoll rises out of the plain in Oklahoma, north and west of the Wichita Range. For my people, the Kiowas, it is an old landmark, and they gave it the name Rainy Mountain. The hardest weather in the world is there. Winter brings blizzards, hot tornadic winds arise in the spring, and in summer the prairie is an anvil's edge. The grass turns brittle and brown, and it cracks beneath your feet. There are green belts along the rivers and creeks, linear groves of hickory and pecan, willow and witch hazel. At a distance in July or August the steaming foliage seems almost to writhe in fire. Great green and yellow grasshoppers are everywhere in the tall grass, popping up like corn to sting the flesh, and tortoises crawl about on the red earth, going nowhere in the plenty of time.  Loneliness is an aspect of the land. All things in the plain are isolate; there is no confusion of objects in the eye, but one hill or one tree or one man. To look upon that landscape in the early morning, with the sun at your back, is to lose the sense of proportion. Your imagination comes to life, and this, you think, is where Creation was begun.  I returned to Rainy Mountain in July. My grandmother had died in the spring, and I wanted to be at her grave. She had lived to be very old and at last infirm. Her only living daughter was with her when she died, and I was told that in death her face was that of a child.  I like to think of her as a child. When she was born, the Kiowas were living the last great moment of their history. For more than a hundred years they had controlled the open range from the Smoky Hill River to the Red, from the headwaters of the Canadian to the fork of the Arkansas and Cimarron. In alliance with the Comanches, they had ruled the whole of the southern Plains. War was their sacred business, and they were among the finest horsemen the world has ever known. But warfare for the Kiowas was preeminently a matter of disposition rather than of survival, and they never understood the grim, unrelenting advance of the U.S. Cavalry. When at last, divided and ill provisioned, they were driven onto the Staked Plains in the cold rains of autumn, they fell into panic. In Palo Duro Canyon they abandoned their crucial stores to pillage and had nothing then but their lives. In order to save themselves, they surrendered to the soldiers at Fort Sill and were imprisoned in the old stone corral that now stands as a military museum. My grandmother was spared the humiliation of those high gray walls by eight or ten years, but she must have known from birth the affliction of defeat, the dark brooding of old warriors.  Her name was Aho, and she belonged to the last culture to evolve in North America. Her forebears came down from the high country in western Montana nearly three centuries ago. They were a mountain people, a mysterious tribe of hunters whose language has never been positively classified in any major group. In the late seventeenth century they began a long migration to the south and east. It was a journey toward the dawn, and it led to a golden age. Along the way the Kiowas were befriended by the Crows, who gave them the culture and religion of the Plains. They acquired horses, and their ancient nomadic spirit was suddenly free of the ground. They acquired Tai-me, the sacred Sun Dance doll, from that moment the object and symbol of their worship, and so shared in the divinity of the sun. Not least, they acquired the sense of destiny, therefore courage and pride. When they entered upon the southern Plains they had been transformed. No longer were they slaves to the simple necessity of survival; they were a lordly and dangerous society of fighters and thieves, hunters and priests of the sun. According to their origin myth, they entered the world through a hollow log. From one point of view, their migration was the fruit of an old prophecy, for indeed they emerged from a sunless world.  Although my grandmother lived out her long life in the shadow of Rainy Mountain, the immense landscape of the continental interior lay like memory in her blood. She could tell of the Crows, whom she had never seen, and of the Black Hills, where she had never been. I wanted to see in reality what she had seen more perfectly in the mind's eye, and traveled fifteen hundred miles to begin my pilgrimage.  Yellowstone, it seemed to me, was the top of the world, a region of deep lakes and dark timber, canyons and waterfalls. But, beautiful as it is, one might have the sense of confinement there. The skyline in all directions is close at hand, the high wall of the woods and deep cleavages of shade. There is a perfect freedom in the mountains, but it belongs to the eagle and the elk, the badger and the bear. The Kiowas reckoned their stature by the distance they could see, and they were bent and blind in the wilderness.  Descending eastward, the highland meadows are a stairway to the plain. In July the inland slope of the Rockies is luxuriant with flax and buckwheat, stonecrop and larkspur. The earth unfolds and the limit of the land recedes. Clusters of trees, and animals grazing far in the distance, cause the vision to reach away and wonder to build upon the mind. The sun follows a longer course in the day, and the sky is immense beyond all comparison. The great billowing clouds that sail upon it are shadows that move upon the grain like water, dividing light. Farther down, in the land of the Crows and Blackfeet, the plain is yellow. Sweet clover takes hold of the hills and bends upon itself to cover and seal the soil. There the Kiowas paused on their way; they had come to the place where they must change their lives. The sun is at home on the plains. Precisely there does it have the certain character of a god. When the Kiowas came to the land of the Crows, they could see the darklees of the hills at dawn across the Bighorn River, the profusion of light on the grain shelves, the oldest deity ranging after the solstices. Not yet would they veer southward to the caldron of the land that lay below; they must wean their blood from the northern winter and hold the mountains a while longer in their view. They bore Tai-me in procession to the east.  A dark mist lay over the Black Hills, and the land was like iron. At the top of a ridge I caught sight of Devil's Tower upthrust against the gray sky as if in the birth of time the core of the earth had broken through its crust and the motion of the world was begun. There are things in nature that engender an awful quiet in the heart of man; Devil's Tower is one of them. Two centuries ago, because they could not do otherwise, the Kiowas made a legend at the base of the rock. My grandmother said: Eight children were there at play, seven sisters and their brother. Suddenly the boy was struck dumb; he trembled and began to run upon his hands and feet. His fingers became claws, and his body was covered with fur. Directly there was a bear where the boy had been. The sisters were terrified; they ran, and the bear after them. They came to the stump of a great tree, and the tree spoke to them. It bade them climb upon it, and as they did so it began to rise into the air. The bear came to kill them, but they were just beyond its reach. It reared against the tree and scored the bark all around with its claws. The seven sisters were borne into the sky, and they became the stars of the Big Dipper.  From that moment, and so long as the legend lives, the Kiowas have kinsmen in the night sky. Whatever they were in the mountains, they could be no more. However tenuous their well-being, however much they had suffered and would suffer again, they had found a way out of the wilderness.  My grandmother had a reverence for the sun, a holy regard that now is all but gone out of mankind. There was a wariness in her, and an ancient awe. She was a Christian in her later years, but she had come a long way about, and she never forgot her birthright. As a child she had been to the Sun Dances; she had taken part in those annual rites, and by them she had learned the restoration of her people in the presence of Tai-me. She was about seven when the last Kiowa Sun Dance was held in 1887 on the Washita River above Rainy Mountain Creek. The buffalo were gone. In order to consummate the ancient sacrifice--to impale the head of a buffalo bull upon the medicine tree--a delegation of old men journeyed into Texas, there to beg and barter for an animal from the Goodnight herd.  She was ten when the Kiowas came together for the last time as a living Sun Dance culture. They could find no buffalo; they had to hang an old hide from the sacred tree. Before the dance could begin, a company of soldiers rode out from Fort Sill under orders to disperse the tribe. Forbidden without cause the essential act of their faith, having seen the wild herds slaughtered and left to rot upon the ground, the Kiowas backed away forever from the medicine tree. That was July 20, 1890, at the great bend of the Washita. My grandmother was there. Without bitterness, and for as long as she lived, she bore a vision of deicide.  Now that I can have her only in memory, I see my grandmother in the several postures that were peculiar to her: standing at the wood stove on a winter morning and turning meat in a great iron skillet; sitting at the south window, bent above her beadwork, and afterwards, when her vision failed, looking down for a long time into the fold of her hands; going out upon a cane, very slowly as she did when the weight of age came upon her; praying. I remember her most often at prayer. She made long, rambling prayers out of suffering and hope, having seen many things. I was never sure that I had the right to hear, so exclusive were they of all mere custom and company. The last time I saw her she prayed standing by the side of her bed at night, naked to the waist, the light of a kerosene lamp moving upon her dark skin. Her long, black hair, always drawn and braided in the day, lay upon her shoulders and against her breasts like a shawl. I do not speak Kiowa, and I never understood her prayers, but there was something inherently sad in the sound, some merest hesitation upon the syllables of sorrow. She began in a high and descending pitch, exhausting her breath to silence; then again and again--and always the same intensity of effort, of something that is, and is not, like urgency in the human voice. Transported so in the dancing light among the shadows of her room, she seemed beyond the reach of time. But that was illusion; I think I knew then that I should not see her again. Houses are like sentinels in the plain, old keepers of the weather watch. There, in a very little while, wood takes on the appearance of great age. All colors wear soon away in the wind and rain, and then the wood is burned gray and the grain appears and the nails turn red with rust. The windowpanes are black and opaque; you imagine there is nothing within, and indeed there are many ghosts, bones given up to the land. They stand here and there against the sky, and you approach them for a longer time than you expect. They belong in the distance; it is their domain.  Once there was a lot of sound in my grandmother's house, a lot of coming and going, feasting and talk. The summers there were full of excitement and reunion. The Kiowas are a summer people; they abide the cold and keep to themselves, but when the season turns and the land becomes warm and vital they cannot hold still; an old love of going returns upon them. The aged visitors who came to my grandmother's house when I was a child were made of lean and leather, and they bore themselves upright. They wore great black hats and bright ample shirts that shook in the wind. They rubbed fat upon their hair and wound their braids with strips of colored cloth. Some of them painted their faces and carried the scars of old and cherished enmities. They were an old council of warlords, come to remind and be reminded of who they were. Their wives and daughters served them well. The women might indulge themselves; gossip was at once the mark and compensation of their servitude. They made loud and elaborate talk among themselves, full of jest and gesture, fright and false alarm. They went abroad in fringed and flowered shawls, bright beadwork and German silver. They were at home in the kitchen, and they prepared meals that were banquets.  There were frequent prayer meetings, and great nocturnal feasts. When I was a child I played with my cousins outside, where the lamplight fell upon the ground and the singing of the old people rose up around us and carried away into the darkness. There were a lot of good things to eat, a lot of laughter and surprise. And afterwards, when the quiet returned, I lay down with my grandmother and could hear the frogs away by the river and feel the motion of the air.  Now there is a funeral silence in the rooms, the endless wake of some final word. The walls have closed in upon my grandmother's house. When I returned to it in mourning, I saw for the first time in my life how small it was. It was late at night, and there was a white moon, nearly full. I sat for a long time on the stone steps by the kitchen door. From there I could see out across the land; I could see the long row of trees by the creek, the low light upon the rolling plains, and the stars of the Big Dipper. Once I looked at the moon and caught sight of a strange thing. A cricket had perched upon the handrail, only a few inches away from me. My line of vision was such that the creature filled the moon like a fossil. It had gone there, I thought, to live and die, for there, of all places, was its small definition made whole and eternal. A warm wind rose up and purled like the longing within me. The next morning I awoke at dawn and went out on the dirt road to Rainy Mountain. It was already hot, and the grasshoppers began to fill the air. Still, it was early in the morning, and the birds sang out of the shadows. The long yellow grass on the mountain shone in the bright light, and a scissortail hied above the land. There, where it ought to be, at the end of a long and legendary way, was my grandmother's grave. Here and there on the dark stones were ancestral names. Looking back once, I saw the mountain and came away.Embed",en

Despacito,Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee Featuring Justin Bieber,36,2017,"1 ContributorIs Music Really Haram? The Sad Reality of Today’s Music. LyricsIs Music Really Haram?  It’s the question almost everyone wants to argue about and the debate that never seems to end.  And before you drop the “Haram Police” card and get ready to prepare an essay response in the comments, can I just say that I’m not here to argue the different rulings and opinions on musical instruments, singing, beat boxing, drums and what not. I’m not even going to go there.  I’m going to be doing something different.  I want us to answer this question for ourselves, openly and honestly. In fact, we can even forget I even said the word Haram to begin with.  Let’s instead just ask the question “Is Music harmful?”  And when we say music, I’m going to be very blank, I’m referring to the music that the majority of people are listening to today because that’s what we should be concerned about. The music that’s on our radios, TV’s, phones and iTunes playlists on repeat. The songs that are topping the charts week-in-week-out and have us memorizing their lyrics from A-Z. This is the music I’m referring to.  Should we, as Muslims be fine listening to this stuff?  Well, let’s take a look for yourselves and decide.  The Hot 100 Billboard Charts has these songs topping the charts for the current week.   Despacito: Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee Featuring Justin Bieber  “You fit me tailor-made, love how you put it on Got the only key, know how to turn it on”  Wild Thoughts: DJ Khaled, Rhianna, Bryson Teller  “I don’t know if you could take it Know you wanna see me nakey, nakey, naked”   That’s what I like: Bruno Mars  “Go pop it for a player, pop-pop it for me Turn around and drop it for a player, drop-drop it for me”   I’m the One: DJ Khaled, Justin Bieber, Lil Wayne, Quavo  “Roll my eyes And when she on the molly she a zombie”   Unforgettable: French Montanna  “If you loved the girl then I’m so, so sorry I got to give it to her like we in a marriage No, no I won’t tell nobody” “If you want drama, Grab the Uzi”.   A quick Google search of the lyrics of these songs will let you know exactly the kinds of messages they contain. You honestly don’t have to read far until you come across references to drugs, sexual promiscuity, violence or alcohol. Even when lyrics can seem somewhat innocent, they are underlined with the most vulgar and shameless of meanings. And the saddest part of it all, there’s even some Muslims actually making these songs.  And yes, I’m sure we can argue all day that not all songs are this bad and there are some “good songs” out there, but the fact of the matter is the statistics speak for themselves when they mention that the vast majority of today’s music is riddled with such references and as the day’s go by content is only getting worse.  And as I’ve mentioned before, I’m not here to argue the Islamic rulings on instruments and the various opinions of scholars on music, because, in all honesty, these opinions are irrelevant when we consider them in light of the music being listened to today. I mean, do you seriously want to argue the permissibility of instruments when Muslims are listening to Nicki Minaj?  And we can go ahead and argue that we’re strong and that the music isn’t necessarily influencing us, but the fact of the matter is – it does. And whether you realize it or not, when you constantly grant such music free access to your ears, it is affecting you. It’s normalizing the worst of sins to the point we can sing about them happily and joyfully.  And if you were so sure that the things you listen to won’t affect your life, why not switch up a music playlist with some Quran and see what change it would have in your life. Even if you don’t understand a word being recited, just listen to it and see what kind of impact it will leave on your soul. There’s no denying that our ears are gateways into our hearts and we should be very careful who we allow access to.  And lastly, I know we all have shortcomings and weaknesses, and I know not all of us are the perfect ideal Muslims – but the least we can do is acknowledge that it’s wrong so that perhaps we can start making an effort to change.  May Allah help us all.Embed",en

Is it the bar I set? My arms, I stretch, but I can’t reach A far cry from it, or it's in my grasp, but as Soon as I grab, squeeze I lose my grip like the flying trapeze Into the dark I plummet, now the sky's blackening I know the mark’s high, butter- ​flies rip apart my stomach Knowin' that no matter what bars I come with You're gonna harp, gripe, and That's a hard Vicodin to swallow, so I scrap these As pressure increases like khakis I feel the ice cracking, because—  [Chorus: Beyoncé & Eminem] I walk on water But I ain't no Jesus (It's the curse of the—, it's the curse of the—) I walk on water (Shit) But only when it freezes You might also like[Verse 2: Eminem] It's the curse of the standard, that the first of the Mathers disc set Always in search of the verse that I haven’t spit yet Will this step just be another misstep To tarnish whatever the legacy, love or respect I’ve garnered? The rhyme has to be perfect, the delivery flawless And it always feels like I'm hittin’ the mark 'Til I go sit in the car, listen and pick it apart Like, ""This shit is garbage"" God's given me all this, still I feel no different regardless Kids look to me as a god, this is retarded If only they knew, it's a facade and it’s exhaustive And I try not to listen to nonsense But if you bitches are tryin' to strip me of my confidence Mission accomplished I'm not God-sent, Nas, Rakim, 'Pac, B.I.G., James Todd Smith And I'm not Prince, so…  [Chorus: Beyoncé & Eminem] I walk on water But I ain't no Jesus I walk on water (It's true, I'm a Rubik's—, it's true—) But only when it freezes (It's true—) [Post-Chorus: Beyoncé] 'Cause I'm only human, just like you Makin' my mistakes, oh, if you only knew I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do 'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh  [Verse 3: Eminem] It's true, I'm a Rubik's—a beautiful mess At times juvenile, yes, I goof and I jest A flawed human, I guess But I'm doin' my best to not ruin your ex- ​pectations and meet 'em, but first The ""Speedom"" verse, now Big Sean He's goin' too fast, is he gonna shout or curse out his mom? There was a time I had the world by the balls, eatin' out my palm Every album song I was spazzin' the fuck out on And now I'm gettin' clowned and frowned on But the only one who's looking down on Me that matters now's DeShaun Am I lucky to be around this long? Begs the question though Especially after the methadone As yesterday fades and the Dresden home Is burnt to the ground and all that's left of my house is lawn The crowds are gone And it's time to wash out the blonde Sales decline, the curtain's drawn They're closin' the set, I'm still pokin' my head from out behind And everyone who has doubt, remind Now take your best rhyme, outdo it, now do it a thousand times Now let 'em tell ya the world no longer cares Or gives a fuck about your rhymes And as I grow outta sight, outta mind, I might go outta mine 'Cause how do I ever let this mic go without a fight When I made a fuckin' tightrope outta twine? But when I do fall from these heights though, I'll be fine I won't pout or cry or spiral down or whine But I'll decide if it's my final bow this time around, 'cause— [Chorus: Beyoncé] I walk on water But I ain't no Jesus I walk on water But only when it freezes  [Post-Chorus: Beyoncé] 'Cause I'm only human, just like you I've been makin' my mistakes, oh, if you only knew I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do 'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh If I walked on water, I would drown  [Outro: Eminem] 'Cause I'm just a man But as long as I got a mic, I'm godlike So me and you are not alike Bitch, I wrote ""Stan""442Embed",en

Believe,Eminem,92,2017,"341 ContributorsTranslationsItalianoTürkçeBelieve Lyrics[Verse 1] And I started from the bottom Like a snowman—ground-up Like round chuck, and still put hands on you Stayin' wound up is how I spend time (Get it?) Sucker free, confidence high Such a breeze when I pen rhymes I just got that air about me like wind chimes (Yeah) 'Nother day in the life (Uh) Used to have to scrape to get by (Yeah) Now my community's gated and I Made it and my neighbors say hi (Say hi) I'm givin' 'em pounds, I'm upscale now Guess it means I'm way in the sky (Way in the sky) But I still remember the days of Minimum wage for general labor Welfare recipient since a minor Look how government assistance has made ya! Adversity, if at first you don't succeed Put your temper to more use 'Cause bein' broke's a poor excuse That should only give you more fuel Show 'em why you're you So close, God, it's like I almost got it But close only counts in time bombs and horseshoes So I Unabomb shit—tick, tick, tick—no remorse, pew! Screw it, I'm lit, and that attitude I blew up on quick That's why they call me firecracker I grew up on WIC—wick, wick, wick—with a short fuse I got some important news to report to Anyone who thought I was done: nah bitch, not quite Spotlight's back on, got my faith, where's yours? You might also like[Chorus] Do you still believe in me? Didn't I give everything I had to give you to make you see? I'll never forget if you turn your back on me now And walk out, I will never let you live it down I'll never quit, do you still believe in me?  [Verse 2] Man, I know sometimes These thoughts can be harsh and cold as ice To me they're just ink blots I just fling 'em like slingshots and so precise So you might wanna think it over twice (Yeah) Or you retards can roll the dice But beef will at least cost you your career 'Cause even my cheap shots are overpriced But this middle finger's free as a bird Nuke warhead at birth, hugest forehead on Earth Too short for the verse, studied his formula, learned How to incorporate a curse Point it towards corporate America Stick a fork in and turn 'Cause four-letter words are more better heard The world force-fed a turd to me, you're getting yours But sometimes I overdo it, but I just get so into it I was there consolin' you when no one knew it When your situation showed no improvement I was that door, you walked over to it I'm the light at the end of the tunnel So people are always lookin' to me as they're goin' through it When that tunnel vision is unclear Shit becomes too much to bear Since ""Cleanin' Out My Closet"" When I was havin' trouble with the snare I'm that unrealistic prayer answered And I'ma get you jacked up like you're tryna fix a flat, uh When you struggle with despair That double-fisted, bare-knuckles coupled with this pair Of nuts I'm cuppin', I am your 'fuck it' switch, nothin' can compare [Chorus] Do you still believe in me? Didn't I give everything I had to give you to make you see? I'll never forget if you turn your back on me now And walk out, I will never let you live it down I'll never quit, do you still believe in me?  [Verse 3] Started from the bottom like a snowman Oh man, put that in your corncob pipe and smoke that But my battery's low, I'ma need a boost to my pack And I know that I always got Proof at my back I called you ""Proof"" because I knew for a fact My ace in the hole, homie, I'm callin' on you 'Cause I think I'm slowly startin' to lose faith in it, so Give me that inkling and mo– –tivation to go, Hussein with the flow Fake fans that are two-faced didn't show Let heartbeats loop, produce hate in my soul Layin' vocals two days in a row True statement, hate to go down this road But there's only one route to cross this bridge So I walk in this bitch with loose change 'Cause all my dues paid, but this booth's takin' its toll But it's never too late to start a new beginnin' That goes for you too, so what the fuck you gon' do? Use the tools you're given! Or you're gon' use the cards you're dealt As an excuse for you to not do shit with 'em? I used to play the loser/victim 'Til I saw the way Proof was driven I found my vehicle and I haven't ran out of gas yet And when they stacked decks, turn handicaps into assets Fanny packs, hourglasses If time was on my side, I'd still have none to waste Man, in my younger days That dream was so much fun to chase It's like I'd run in place While this shit dangled in front of my face But how do you keep up the pace And the hunger pangs once you've won the race? When that dual exhaust is coolin' off 'Cause you don't got nothin' left to prove at all 'Cause you done already hit 'em with the coup de grâce Still you feel the need to go full tilt That Bruce Willis, that Blue Steel, that true skill When that wheel's loose, I won't lose will Do you still believe?337Embed",en

My father will be pacing the floor (Listen to the fireplace roar) So, really, I'd better scurry (Beautiful, please don't hurry) But maybe just a half a drink more (Put some records on while I pour) The neighbors might think (Baby, it's bad out there) Say, what's in this drink?
